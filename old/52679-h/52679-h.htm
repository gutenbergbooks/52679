<h2 id="PREFATORY_NOTE">PREFATORY NOTE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">Professor Morgan</span> desires to express his obligations
to the Russian Embassy, the Foreign Office, the Home
Office, the French Ministry of War, and the General
Headquarters Staff of the British Expeditionary
Force for the assistance which they have given him.
For the opinions expressed in Part IV. of the Introductory
Chapter Professor Morgan is alone responsible.
The whole of the documents given in the
“Documentary Chapter” of this book (except the
Memorandum from the German White Book which
has been published in German, though not, of course,
in English) are now published for the first time.

<h3 id="THE_BRITISH_ENQUIRY">I<br />

THE BRITISH ENQUIRY</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> second chapter of this book has already appeared
in the pages of the June issue of the <cite>Nineteenth Century
and After</cite>. At the time of its appearance numerous
suggestions were made&mdash;notably by the
<cite>Morning Post</cite> and the <cite>Daily Chronicle</cite>&mdash;that it should
be republished in a cheaper and more accessible
form. A similar suggestion has come to us from the
Ministry of War in Paris, reinforced by the intimation
that the review containing the article was not
obtainable owing to its having immediately gone out
of print. Since then an official reprint has been
largely circulated in neutral countries by the British
Government, and an abbreviated reprint of it has
been published by the Parliamentary Recruiting Committee
in the form of a pamphlet. The Secretary to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
the Committee informs me that considerably over a
million and a half copies of this pamphlet have been
circulated.</p>

<p>At the suggestion of Mr. Fisher Unwin, and by the
courtesy of the editor of the <cite>Nineteenth Century</cite>, the
article is now republished as a whole, but with it is
published for the first time a documentary chapter
containing a selection of illustrative documents, none
of which have hitherto appeared in print. For permission
to publish them I am chiefly indebted to the
Home Office and the Foreign Office. Needless to say,
the original article also was submitted to the Home
Office authorities, by whom it was duly read and approved
before publication. These documents by no
means exhaust the unpublished evidence in my possession,
but my object has been not to multiply proofs
but to exemplify them, and, in particular, as is explained
in the following chapter, to supplement the
Bryce Report on matters which, owing to the exigencies
of space and the pre-occupation with the case
of Belgium, occupy a comparatively subordinate
place in that document. This volume may, in fact,
be regarded as a postscript to the Bryce Report&mdash;it
does not pretend to be anything more.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a></p>

<p>There is, however, an extremely important aspect
of the question which has not yet been the subject
of an official report in this country, and that is the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
German White Book.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> It has never been published
in England, and is very difficult to obtain. There
is some reason to believe that the German Government
now entertain considerable misgivings about the
expediency of its original publication, and are none
too anxious to circulate it. The reason will, I think,
be tolerably obvious to anyone who will do me the
honour to read the critical analysis which follows.</p>

<p>I will not attempt to prejudice that analysis at
this stage. I shall have something to say later in
this chapter as to the credibility of the German Government
in these matters. It is a rule of law that,
when a defendant puts his character in issue, or
makes imputations on the prosecutor or his witnesses,
as the Germans have done, his character may legitimately
be the subject of animadversion. To impeach
it at this stage might appear, however, to beg the
question of the value of the White Book, which is
best examined as a matter of internal evidence without
the importation of any reflections on the character
of its authors.</p>

<p>As regards the value of the evidence on the other
side&mdash;the English, Belgian, and French Reports&mdash;I
doubt if any careful reader requires persuasion as
to their authenticity. In the case of the Bryce Report,
the studied sobriety of its tone&mdash;to say nothing
of the known integrity and judiciousness of its authors&mdash;carried
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span>
instant conviction to the minds of all
honest and thoughtful men, and that conviction was
assuredly not disturbed by the vituperative description
of it by the <cite>K&ouml;lnische Zeitung</cite> as a “mean collection
of official lies.” No attempt has ever been
made to answer it. As regards the French Reports,
which are not as fully known in this country as they
might be,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> I had the honour of working in collaboration
with M. Mollard, a member of the French Commission
of Inquiry, and I was greatly impressed with
their scrupulous regard for truth, and their inflexible
insistence on corroboration. My own methods of
inquiry are sufficiently indicated in the chapter which
follows, but I may add two illustrations of what, I
think, may fairly be described as the scrupulousness
with which the inquiries at General Headquarters
were conducted. The reader may remember that in
May of last year a report as to the crucifixion of two
Canadian soldiers obtained wide currency in this
country. A Staff officer and myself immediately instituted
inquiries by means of a visit to the Canadian
Headquarters, at that time situated in the neighbourhood
of Ypres, and by the cross-examination of
wounded Canadians on the way to the base. We
found that this atrocity was a matter of common belief
among the Canadian soldiers, and at times we
seemed to be on a hot scent, but eventually we failed
to discover any one who had been an actual eye-witness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
of the atrocity in question. It may or may
not have occurred&mdash;we have had irrefragable proof
that such things have occurred&mdash;and it is conceivable
that those who saw it had perished and their testimony
with them. But it was felt that mere hearsay
evidence, however strong, was not admissible, and,
as a result, no report was ever issued.</p>

<p>In the other case a man in a Highland regiment,
on discovering himself in hospital in the company of
a wounded Prussian, attempted to assault the latter,
swearing that he had seen him bayoneting a wounded
British soldier as he lay helpless upon the field. He
was positive as to the identification and there could
be no doubt as to the sincerity of his statements. But
as one Prussian Guardsman is very like another&mdash;the
facial and cranial uniformity is remarkable&mdash;and
there was no corroboration as to identity, no action
was taken. As to the fact of the atrocity having
occurred there could, however, be no doubt.</p>

<p>I may add that the numerous British officers whom
I interrogated in the earlier stages of the war showed
a marked disinclination&mdash;innate, I think, in the British
character&mdash;to believe stories reflecting upon the
honour of the foe to whom they were opposed in the
field. But at a later stage I found that this indulgent
scepticism had wholly disappeared. Facts had been
too intractable, experience too harsh, disillusion too
bitter. The lesson has been dearly learnt&mdash;many a
brave and chivalrous officer has owed his death to the
treachery of a mean and unscrupulous foe. But it
has been learnt once and for all. And, indeed, judging
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
by the information which reaches me from various
sources, the enemy affords our men no chance of
forgetting it.</p>

<h3 id="THE_GERMAN_CASE_A_CRITICAL_ANALYSIS_OF_THE_GERMAN_WHITE_BOOK">II<br />

THE GERMAN CASE&mdash;A CRITICAL ANALYSIS OF THE GERMAN
WHITE BOOK</h3>

<p><span class="smcap">On</span> May 10th&mdash;some five days before the publication
of the Bryce Report&mdash;the German Government drew
up a voluminous White Book purporting to be a
Report on Offences against International Law in the
conduct of the war by the Belgians. It may be described
as a kind of intelligent anticipation of the
case they might have to meet; the actual case, as presented
in the Bryce Report, they have never attempted
to meet, and to this day that report has
never been answered. The German White Book&mdash;of
which no translation is accessible to the public in
this country&mdash;has attracted very little attention over
here, and I propose to make a close and reasoned analysis
of it, for no more damning and incriminating
defence has ever been put forth by a nation arraigned
at the bar of public opinion. In doing so I shall rely
on the German Report itself and shall make no attempt
to refute it by drawing upon the evidence of
the English and Belgian Reports, convincing though
that is, because to do so might seem to beg the question
at issue, which is the relative credibility of the
parties.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span></p>

<h4>German Invocation of The Hague Conventions.</h4>

<p>The case which the German Government had avowedly
to meet was the wholesale slaughter of Belgian
civilians, and the fact of such slaughter having taken
place they make no attempt to deny. They enter a
plea of justification and, in a word, they attempt to
argue that the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lev&eacute;e en masse</em> or “People’s War” of
the Belgian nation was not conducted in accordance
with the terms of the Hague regulations relating to
improvised resistance in cases of this kind. I will not
here go over the well-trodden ground of Belgian neutrality;
it is enough that in a now notorious utterance
the Imperial Chancellor has admitted that the German
invasion was a breach of international law.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p>The substance of the Hague Convention<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> is that
the civil population of a country at war are entitled
to recognition as lawful belligerents if they conform
to four conditions. They must have a responsible
commander; they must wear a distinctive and recognisable
badge; they must carry their arms openly;
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
and they must conduct their operations in accordance
with the laws and customs of war. In the case, however,
of an invasion, where there has been no time
to organise in conformity with this article, the first
and second conditions are expressly dispensed with,
provided there is compliance with the third and
fourth. Now, not only have these rules been subscribed
by the German representatives and, according
to Baron Marschall von Bieberstein, their principal
spokesman at the Hague Conference, such subscription
was absolute and unconditional;<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> but the principle
which they embody has been accepted by all
the leading German jurists. “There exists no ground
for denying to the masses of a country the natural
right to defend their Fatherland ...; it is only
by such levies that the smaller and less powerful
States can defend themselves.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> The same authority
argues that no State is bound to limit itself to
its regular army; it could, he adds, call up civil
guards or even women and children, who in such case
would be entitled to the rights of lawful belligerents.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></p>

<p>What then is the German justification for the massacre
of the Belgian civilians? Its main contention
is that the Belgian Government “had <em>sufficient time</em>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
for an <em>organisation</em> of the People’s War as required
by international law”;<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a> in other words that a spontaneous
and unorganised resistance in Belgium could
not claim the immunities of Article 2 of the Hague
Regulations. The effrontery of this contention is truly
amazing. The Belgian Government had, at the most,
two days&mdash;two days in which to organise a whole nation
for defence. The German ultimatum to Belgium
was issued on August 2nd; the violation of Belgian
territory took place on August 4th. How could a
little nation with a small standing army organise its
whole population on a military basis within two days
against the most powerful and mobile army in Europe,
equipped with all the modern engines of war?
The German Government do, indeed, attempt to support
their contention by urging further that “the
preparation of mobilisation began, as can be proved,
at least a week before the invasion of the German
Army.”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a> Now, granting&mdash;and it is granting a great
deal&mdash;that a week would be sufficient to organise untrained
civilians for defence, it would still remain to
be proved that the Belgian Government <em>did</em> begin
to mobilise a week beforehand. The German White
Book does not prove it; the Belgian Grey Book disproves
it. The Belgian Government, relying on the
plighted faith of Germany, had not even begun to
mobilise on July 29th&mdash;six days before the invasion.<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
Indeed, it was only on July 24th that they were sufficiently
alarmed to address interrogatories to the
Great Powers, Germany among them, for assurances
as to the immunity of Belgium from attack.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> As late
as July 31st the German Government effectually concealed
its intentions.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> It is, in fact, a matter of common
notoriety that the German move against Belgium
was as sudden in execution as it was premeditated
in design. She entered like a thief in the night.</p>

<h4>Charges against the Belgian Government.</h4>

<p>The main contention of the German Government
therefore falls to the ground. What remains? It is
here that the German answer betrays itself by its
disingenuousness. There is an old rule of pleading,
familiar to lawyers, which says a traverse must be
neither too large nor too narrow. This is just the
error into which the German contention falls. The
apologies are too anxious to prove everything in turn
as the occasion suits, forgetting that one of their contentions
often refutes the other. In the introductory
memorandum they argue that Belgium had time to
organise and did not. In their excuse for the massacre
at Dinant, and their zeal to prove that the military
exigencies were overwhelming, they say that
“the organisation”&mdash;of civilian resistance&mdash;“was
remarkable for its careful preparation and wide extent”;
“that the guns were only partly sporting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
guns and revolvers but partly also machine guns and
Belgian military weapons proves that the organisation
had the support of the Belgian Government.”<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a>
In other words, in one part of the White Book they
insist that the resistance was ruthlessly punished
because it was not organised; in another that because
it was organised it had to be ruthlessly repressed. In
another place,<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> having to justify their peculiar principle
of vicarious responsibility by which the innocent
have to answer for the guilty, they say that the
Belgian Government and the municipal hostages
whom the Germans executed ought to have stopped
“this guerilla warfare,” and did not do so. Now it
is well known, and the German Government admits
it, that the public authorities issued proclamations ordering
the people to abstain from hostilities and to
surrender their arms. How does the German Government
meet this? The only evidence they can produce
in the whole of their pompous dossier is (1)
the deposition of a German Jew, resident in Brussels,
to the effect that, seeing the proclamation, he sent
his servant to the Belgian authorities to deliver up a
revolver, and that the servant came back and said
that the Commissioner of Police had told him not to
trouble as “one need not believe everything that is
in the papers”;<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a> (2) the deposition of a German
lieutenant that an officer (not named) once showed
him a document (not produced), which, “according
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
to his own account” he had found in the town hall
of a neighbouring village (not indicated), containing
an invitation on the part of the Belgian Government,
addressed to the population, to render armed resistance
in return for payment.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> On such flimsy hearsay
evidence, tendered by two Germans, rests the
whole of the German case against the Belgian Government.</p>

<h4>Belgian “Atrocities.”</h4>

<p>Like a defendant who has no case, the German
Government attempt to plead generally in default
of being able to plead specifically. They therefore
put forward a sweeping generalisation to the effect
that, quite apart from the question whether the Belgians
did or did not comply with the formal requirements
of the Hague Convention, they violated all the
usages of war by “unheard of” atrocities. “Finally
it is proved beyond all doubt that German
wounded were robbed and killed by the Belgian population,
and indeed were subjected to horrible mutilation,
and that even women and young girls took
part in these shameful actions. In this way the eyes
of German wounded were torn out, their ears, nose,
fingers and sexual organs cut off, or their body cut
open.”<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a> Let us consider the depositions with which
this accusation is supported.</p>

<p>(1) Hugo Lagershausen, of the 1st Ersatz Company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
of the Reserve, his attention having been drawn
to the significance of the oath, declares:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I lost the other men of the patrol. About noon on August
6th, I came to a dressing station, which was set up on a farm
near the village of Chen&eacute;e. In the house I found about fifteen
severely wounded German soldiers, of whom four or five had
been horribly mutilated; both their eyes had been gouged out,
and some had had several fingers cut off. Their wounds were
relatively fresh although the blood was already somewhat coagulated.
The men were still living and were groaning. It
was not possible for me to help them, as I had already ascertained
by questioning other wounded men lying in that house,
there was no doctor in the place. I also found in the house
six or seven Belgian civilians, four of whom were women;
these gave drinks to the wounded; the men were entirely passive.
I saw no weapons on them, and I cannot say whether
they had blood on their hands, because they put them in their
pockets.”<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It is highly probably, is it not? Musketeer Lagershausen
falls among ghouls who hastily put their incriminating
hands in their pockets and allow him
who was “entirely alone” and powerless to walk
off and inform against them. Truly they must have
been some of the mildest-mannered men who ever
cut a throat.</p>

<p>(2) Musketeer Paul Blankenberg, of Infantry
Regiment No. 165, declares:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We were on the march in closed column and passing
through a Belgian village west of Herve. In the village some
German wounded were lying and I recognised some J&auml;ger of
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
the J&auml;ger Battalion, No. 4. Suddenly the column marching
through was fired upon from the houses, and accordingly the
order was given that all civilians should be removed from the
houses and driven together to one point. <em>While this was being
done</em> I noticed that girls of eight to ten years old, armed with
sharp instruments, busied themselves with the German wounded.
Later, I ascertained that the ear lobes and upper parts of the
ears of the most seriously injured of the wounded had been
cut off.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></p></blockquote>

<p>That is to say, a whole column of German troops
is on the march in close formation, they round up the
civilians and <em>while they are doing this</em> some little
girls continue, in presence of this overwhelming force,
to “busy themselves” by cutting up their comrades
with the contents of their mothers’ work-box.</p>

<p>(3) Landwehrman Alwin Chaton, of the 5th Company
of the Reserve Infantry Regiment No. 78, declared:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In the course of the street fighting in Charleroi, as we
fought our way through the High Street and had reached a side
street leading off the High Street, I saw, when I had reached
the crossing and shot into the side street, a German dragoon
lying in the street about fifty or sixty paces in front of me.
Three civilians were near him, of whom one was bending over
the soldier, who still kicked with his legs. I shot among them
and hit the last of the civilians; the others fled. When I approached
I saw that the shot civilian had a long knife, covered
with blood, in his hand. The right eye of the German dragoon
was gouged out.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The witness adds that “much smoke was rising
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
from the body of the dragoon,” This is to say that a
general engagement, one of the hardest fought during
the war, is going on in the middle of a town and
three civilians are discovered within fifty or sixty
paces, leisurely carving up a German dragoon! Is
it credible?</p>

<p>(4) My fourth example is too long to quote, but in
substance it is this. Reservist G. Gustav Voigt deposes
that on August 6th he and seven comrades suddenly
saw five Belgian soldiers, fully armed, holding
up their arms to surrender. When they went up to
them they discovered that the Belgians had a German
hussar strung up and freshly mutilated, and that
they had two other hussars upon whom they were
about to perform similar operations.<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a> Without firing
a shot, these men, caught red-handed under circumstances
which made their own death inevitable, surrender
immediately.</p>

<p>Now I ask any unbiased reader whether these depositions,
in each case uncorroborated, are such as to
carry conviction to any reasonable man? Yet the
whole of the “proofs” adduced as to Belgian atrocities
are of this character.</p>

<h4>The Massacres&mdash;Andenne.</h4>

<p>When we come to the justification alleged for the
wholesale massacres of communities the evidence is
even more suspicious. In order to prove the Belgians
unspeakable knaves the German Government have to
present them as incredible fools. At Andenne, “a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
small town of a population of about 8,000 people,”
there were affrays in which “about 200 inhabitants
lost their lives.”<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a> According to the German document,
“two infantry regiments and a J&auml;ger battalion”
were marching through this place when they
were set upon by the inhabitants. Two regiments
and a battalion would constitute the greater part of
a brigade; they must have amounted to at least 7,000
men.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> We are asked to believe that this small unprotected
community (one of the German witnesses
expressly says, “I did not see one single French or
Belgian soldier in the entire town or the environs”)<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a>
made an unprovoked attack on this overwhelming
force, and that the women assisted with
pots of scalding water. Two hundred of the civilians
were, by the German admission, shot. The German
losses were, it is added, “singularly small.” So singularly
small were they that the German Report omits
even to enumerate them.</p>

<h4>Jamoigne and Tintigny.</h4>

<p>In another case&mdash;the village of Jamoigne&mdash;an ammunition
column halted for water. The attitude of
the population “was friendly; water, coffee, and tobacco
were offered to some non-commissioned officers
and men.” Suddenly, while part of the population
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
are standing outside their doors fully exposed, “a
general shooting” is opened upon the crowd in the
streets from the roofs and windows of the houses.<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
Is it intrinsically probable that Belgian civilians
would be so careless of the lives of their fellow-citizens?
Or take the case of Tintigny. An artillery
ammunition column is welcomed, “apparently with
the best goodwill,” assisted to water its horses, and
then (but not before) “when the horses had been
again harnessed” and the opportunity for a surprise
attack had passed, the inhabitants opened fire on the
whole column.<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a> Statements like these carry their
own refutation with them.</p>

<h4>The Tragedy of Dinant.</h4>

<p>I turn to the case of Dinant, one of the most appalling
massacres that have ever been perpetrated,<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a>
even by the hordes of Kultur. No attempt is made
to deny the wholesale slaughter; it is freely admitted,
and with sanguinary iteration we are told again and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
again “a fairly large number of persons were shot,
“all the male hostages assembled against the garden
wall were shot.” Such <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">battues</em> occur on page after
page.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> What is the German excuse? It is that the
civilian population offered a desperate resistance. To
prove how desperate it was, and consequently to establish
the “military necessity,” it has to be conceded
that they were organised. But this is proving
too much, for “organised” civilian combatants are
entitled to the privileges of lawful belligerents.
Therefore it is argued that they were “without military
badges”: this phrase occurs with a curious lack
of variation in the words of each witness. It is added
that women and “children (including girls) of ten
or twelve years” were armed with revolvers! “Elderly
women,” “a white-haired old man,” fired with
insensate fury. None the less&mdash;says one ingenuous
German witness&mdash;“the people had all got a very high
opinion of Germany.” At intervals during the engagement
not only were groups of civilians, alleged
to have arms in their hands, shot in groups, but
unarmed civilians were shot&mdash;“all the male hostages.”
In other words the whole of the German
defence that the German troops were punishing illicit
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</em> is suddenly abandoned. Tiring apparently
of these laboured inventions, the German staff,
in a grim and sombre sentence, suddenly throws off
the mask:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In judging the attitude which the troops of the 12th Corps
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
took against such a population, our starting point must be that
the <em>tactical object</em> of the 12th Corps was to cross the Meuse
<em>with speed</em>, and to drive the enemy from the left bank of the
Meuse; speedily to overcome the opposition of the inhabitants
who were working in direct opposition to this <em>was to be striven
for in every way</em>.... Hostages were shot at various places
and this procedure is amply justified.”<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a></p></blockquote>

<p>It has been estimated that about eight hundred
civilians perished in this massacre. The German
White Book freely concedes that the number was
large; indeed by a simple process of induction from
the German evidence it is clear that it was very large.
It appears that a whole Army Corps (the 1st Royal
Saxon) was engaged and that the armed troops of
the Allies were encountered in force. The German
troops received a check and it seems fairly obvious
that they simply wreaked their vengeance, as they
have so often done, on an unoffending population,
presumably in order to intimidate the enemy in the
field. Not for the first time they attempted to do
by terror what they could not do by force of arms.</p>

<h4>“We gave them coffee.”</h4>

<p>It is characteristic of the whole <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">apologia</em> that having
admitted to an indiscriminate butchery the Germans
attempt to gain credit for preserving throughout
its course the most tender sentiments. In fact
they are surprised at their own sensibility. “I
have subsequently often wondered,” says a Major
Schlick, “that our men should have remained so
calm in the face of such beasts.”<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> Major Bauer
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
says, that he and his “manifested a most notable
kindness to women, old men and children”; so notable
that he suggests that “it is worthy of recognition
in the special circumstances.” Major Bauer evidently
thinks it a case for the Iron Cross. And in
proof of this humanity he points out that the widows
and orphans of the murdered husbands and fathers
“all received coffee”<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a> from the field kitchen the
next morning. Perhaps Major Bauer bethinks himself
of a certain cup of cold water.</p>

<h4>The Children were “quite happy.”</h4>

<p>More than this, the children seem rather to have
enjoyed the novel experience. A German staff-surgeon
whose gruesome task it was to search a heap of
forty corpses, “women and young lads,” who had
been put up against a garden wall for execution,
says:<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Under the heap I discovered a girl of about five years of
age, and without any injuries. I took her out and brought her
down to the house where the women were. <em>She took chocolate,
was quite happy, and was clearly unaware of the seriousness of
the situation.</em>”</p></blockquote>

<p>And with that amazing statement we may fitly
leave this amazing narrative.</p>

<h4>Aerschot.</h4>

<p>The case of Dinant may be taken as typical. The
evidence as to Louvain and Aerschot is not less incredible.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
We are asked to believe that at Aerschot<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a>
the population of a small town suddenly rose in arms
against a whole brigade, although the population was
quite unprotected&mdash;“we ascertained that there was
no enemy in the neighbourhood.”<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> To explain this
surprising and suicidal impulse the Germans produce&mdash;it
is their only evidence&mdash;the statement of a Captain
Karge, that he had “heard rumours from various
German officers” that the Belgian Government,
“in particular the King of the Belgians,” had decreed
that every male Belgian was to do the German Army
“as much harm as possible.” “It <em>is said</em> that such
an order was found on a captured Belgian soldier.”
Strangely enough, the order is not produced&mdash;not a
word of it. Also, “an officer <em>told</em> me that he himself
had <em>read</em> on a church door of a place near Aerschot
that the Belgians were not allowed to hold captured
German officers on parole, but were bound to shoot
them.” He adds that he “cannot repeat the words
of this officer exactly.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<h4>Louvain.</h4>

<p>Let us now turn to Louvain. “The <em>insurrection</em>
of the town of Louvain,” say the authors of the
White Book with some na&iuml;vet&eacute;, “against the German
garrison and the punishment which was meted out
to the town have found a long-drawn-out echo in the
whole world.” Some twenty-eight thousand words
are therefore devoted to establishing the thesis that
the German troops in occupation of the town were
the victims of a carefully organised, long premeditated,
and diabolically executed attack on the part of
the inhabitants assisted by the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Garde Civique</em>. Thus:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We are evidently dealing with a carefully planned assault
which was carried on for several days with the greatest obstinacy.
The long duration of the insurrection against the German
military power in itself disposes of any planless action
committed by individuals in excitement. The leadership of the
treacherous revolt must have lain in the hands of a higher
authority.”&mdash;Summarising Report.</p></blockquote>

<p>Great emphasis is laid on the formidable nature
of the attack and the heavy odds against which the
Germans had to contend. The fire of the Belgians
was “murderous” (D 11, D 13), “fearful”
(D 9), “violent” (D 36), “furious” (D 41); it
was supported by machine-guns (D 28, 29, 37, 38,
40) and hand-grenades (D 46), and was materially
assisted by Belgian soldiers in disguise (Appendix
D 1, 19, 38), and by the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Garde Civique</em> (D 45, 46),
who occupied houses with the most “elaborate preparations.”
In spite of this careful preparation the
German troops, who had been in the town six days
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
and had there established the Head-quarters of a
whole Army Corps (the 9th Reserve Corps), were
so impressed by the “extraordinarily good” behaviour
of the inhabitants that on the evening of August
25th, about 7.30 or 8 p.m., they were taken completely
by surprise. “It was impossible to foresee,” says
Lieutenant von Sandt (D 8), “that the inhabitants
were planning an assault.” Other witnesses say,
however, that “a remarkable number of young
men” were observed congregating in the streets some
hours beforehand. None the less the German authorities
exhibited an ingenuous trustfulness and,
what is even more remarkable, a complete disregard
of the most ordinary police precautions, which will
come as a surprise to anyone who has studied the
German Proclamations and the drastic measures usually
taken by them immediately upon their occupation
of a town.</p>

<h4>A “murderous” attack; German casualties&mdash;five.</h4>

<p>Such was the situation when at seven o’clock on
a summer evening (August 25th) of notorious memory,
the deep-laid plans of the Belgian authorities
suddenly and murderously revealed themselves. A
German company of Landsturm<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a> was marching
through the town; the main body of the German
troops quartered there were engaged several miles
away, and only a few details remained in the city.
This small body of unsuspecting soldiers&mdash;a company
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
numbers not more than two or three hundred men&mdash;were
suddenly set upon, at a signal given by rockets,
by trained marksmen of the Belgian Army and the
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Garde Civique</em>, disguised as civilians, acting with the
aid of machine-guns and hand-grenades and actively
assisted by the greater part of a large civilian population.
The fire, as various soldiers of the Landsturm
testify, was not only carefully controlled and directed,
but was “murderous” in the extreme. Yet,
after carefully searching through their depositions,
we find that only “<em>five men of the company were
wounded</em>” (D 8)! Lieutenant Sandt and Dr. Berghausen
feel constrained to explain these remarkably
light casualties. They can only account for them by
saying that in spite of the “carefully planned” and
disciplined attack the Belgians, shooting from carefully
chosen positions, shot “too high” (D 8), “at
night” (D 8, D 9) although the light at eight o’clock
on an August evening is usually remarkably good,
and one of the witnesses (D 26) says that at 8 p.m.
it was “fairly light.” The company appear to have
disarmed the infuriated Belgians with remarkable
ease, going into the houses two or three at a time
(D 9), and finding the occupants apparently as docile
as sheep, so that although found with arms in their
hands they allowed themselves to be led out in “a
crowd” and “immediately shot” (D 44). In one
case, on entering an inn, the Germans found “behind
the bar, a waiter,” who had apparently taken up
this strong strategical position alone with “a case
for shot placed by his side with the corresponding
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
ammunition.” He also allowed himself to be led
forth like a lamb to the slaughter (D 37).</p>

<h4>Contradictory witnesses.</h4>

<p>It is extraordinary also that although this murderous
and carefully planned attack began at 7.30
“I had just finished my soup,” says Major von
Manteuffel, who sat down to dinner at 7.30&mdash;(Appendix
D 3), or at 8 p.m. (D 6), yet at 9 p.m., says
Corporal Hohne, who entered the town with his regiment
at that hour (D 36), “the conduct of the civilians
was quiet and not unfriendly,” and his regiment
was allowed to march right into the town&mdash;“up
till then nothing noteworthy had occurred.” A
N.C.O. of the same battalion says that “between 9
and 10 p.m.” the Belgians were standing about the
streets; all was “quiet,” and they were “not unfriendly”
(D 36). Another witness heard nothing
till “9 or 9.30” (D 25). Another says (D 45) the
signal was given at “9 o’clock.” To the same effect
another soldier (D 18). What is even more remarkable
is the statement of Major von Klewitz that at
4 a.m. the next morning, after the Landsturm had
cleared the houses, the infatuated inhabitants opened
fire on an Army Corps which appears to have arrived
in the interval and was then “moving out to battle”
(D 2); and the presence of a whole brigade of Landwehr
(D 1) does not seem to have exercised any restraining
influence on these insane civilians. Like
flies to wanton boys was a whole Army Corps to the
burgesses of Louvain, who killed it for their sport.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
The German authorities contend that, with intermittent
executions, they tolerated this kind of thing for
two whole days. They appear, however, to have
borne a charmed life&mdash;the chief casualties among
them were horses. Battalion Surgeon Georg Berghausen,
in particular, who records as a remarkable
fact that he once paid a hotelkeeper (“to please him
and his employees”) for meals he had ordered, was
“repeatedly shot at” the whole length of a street
but never so much as hit. He thinks this was due
to its being so dark, though whenever the witnesses
are concerned to testify that the firing was undoubtedly
by civilians, or by soldiers disguised as such,
they can see “quite plainly.”</p>

<h4>The Priests.</h4>

<p>Never since the Day of Pentecost was there such a
confusion of tongues. One witness labours to prove
that no executions took place without a most decorous
court-martial in the station square, the same soldier
combining apparently the office of prosecutor and
judge (D 38); another says that of “a crowd” of
persons taken out of a house, the males were “immediately
shot” (D 44); yet a third says that a body
of hostages were placed in front of a machine-gun
with an intimation that they would be shot as a matter
of course if there were any more disturbance
(D 37). It is admitted that a hundred civilians were
shot, “including ten or fifteen priests” (D 38).
One German witness says it is all the fault of the
priests (D 38); another says it’s the fault of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Garde Civique</em> (D 45)&mdash;both being apparently at
some pains to exculpate the unhappy civilians. The
quality of the evidence against the priests (and the
civil population) may be gathered from the following
deposition (D 42) of Captain Hermansen. He interviewed
a priest who, he says, had behaved well on
one occasion:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I rejoined that if his clerical brethren had acted in that
[the same] manner, the Belgians and we would have been
spared many unpleasant experiences. <em>He did not contradict
me.</em>”&mdash;(D 42.)</p></blockquote>

<p>In witness whereof Captain von Vethacke comes
forward and says:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In so far as priests were shot they too had been found
guilty by the court. I came to know the priest mentioned by
Captain Hermansen at the end of his declaration. He made
an excellent impression on me also; and <em>he did not contradict
me either</em>, when I expressed to him my opinion that certain of
the clergy had stirred up the people and taken part in the attack.”&mdash;(D
43.)</p></blockquote>

<p>Truly, a remarkable example of the <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">argumentum
ab silentio</em>! Perhaps the unfortunate priest remembered
what happened to Faithful when he contradicted
Chief Justice Hategood.</p>

<p>All the evidence adduced, where it is not that of
the German soldiers, is of this character. It is all
hearsay, the Belgian witnesses quoted are invariably
anonymous, and there are only five of them at that
(D 30, 34, 37, 38, 42). At Bueken “the clergymen”
are accused of having incited the population to attack
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
the German troops. The proof adduced is that the
priest “left the church” when the firing began!</p>

<h4>What is the true explanation?</h4>

<p>One thing emerges quite clearly from these disorderly
depositions and that is a great confusion of
mind. The evidence from Belgian sources, very carefully
sifted by a Committee<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> (presided over by Sir
Mackenzie Chalmers) of the Belgian Commission
and, independently, by the Bryce Committee,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> is to
the effect that two detachments of German troops
fired on one another and then threw the blame on the
innocent inhabitants. This explanation certainly
receives some countenance from the German depositions,
which, as I have said, exhibit a kind of turbulent
confusion. The N.C.O.‘s of two battalions which
entered the town at 9 p.m. say “the noise and confusion
was very great,” and “to what extent our fire
was returned I cannot say”; “we shot the street
lamps to pieces”; “our opponents were not to be
seen since it was already dark,” and “we only saw
the flash of the discharges and <em>supposed</em> that they
came from the houses” (D 36, 37); and here again,
as in the case of the company of Landsturm previously
referred to, only “five men” were known
to be hit. During the greater part of the day (August
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
25th) there was only<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> one company of Landsturm
and sixty men of a railway detachment in the
town (D 8). It is surely rather remarkable that
“a well-prepared and elaborately designed attack
on the part of the civil population” (D 41) should
have halted all day and then begun either at or a
short time before (the German evidence is, as we
have seen, very conflicting) German reinforcements
were entering the town, and then tarried again until
the whole or the greater part of a German Army
Corps had arrived: the only thing that the German
evidence proves is the sinister fact that the arrival of
each detachment of German forces coincided with
renewed massacres of the civilian population. Such
is the ugly story that emerges from these ill-nourished
and contradictory testimonies.</p>

<p>Such is the German White Book. I think it is
not too much to say that it bears the stamp of the
forger’s hand upon it, the same hand that forged the
Ems telegram and garbled the Belgian documents
captured in Brussels. It was conceived in iniquity
and brought forth in falsehood. It confesses, but
does not avoid.

<h3 id="GERMAN_CREDIBILITY_A_REVIEW_OF_THE_EVIDENCE">III<br />

GERMAN CREDIBILITY&mdash;A REVIEW OF THE EVIDENCE</h3>

<h4>The German Diaries.</h4>

<p>I have allowed the German White Book to speak
for itself. It is a well-known rule of law that a
party is “estopped” from denying his own admissions,
and the incriminating character of these admissions
is, as we have seen, conclusive against the
German Government. Had I desired, I could have
reinforced it by other evidence, also emanating from
German sources, in the shape of Proclamations and
diaries (of which I have seen some hundreds at the
Ministry of War in Paris), which amply corroborate
the conclusions already arrived at. The German
pretence of a judicial inquiry into the guilt or innocence
of the victims of their sanguinary fury is
refuted by the simple fact that their own Proclamations
frankly intimate that the principle of decimation
and of vicarious punishment will be adopted,
in the case of infractions, whether real or assumed,
of what they choose to call their commands. A
hostage may fail to turn up as a substitute, an inhabitant
may be found with a litre of benzol unaccounted
for, another may dig potatoes in the field,
yet another may fail to salute or to hold his hands
up with sufficient promptitude&mdash;and the penalty
decreed is invariably the same: he, or a substitute,
will be shot&mdash;“the innocent will suffer with the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
guilty.”<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a> Not only so, but as a rule no attempt
was made to discover whether any offence had been
committed or not. In the diary of a German officer
which came into my possession an entry recording
the undiscriminating butchery of some two hundred
civilians concluded with the otiose remark: “In
future there ought to be an inquiry into their guilt
instead of shooting them.” An unpublished Proclamation
in my possession, which was handed to me
by the <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">maire</em> of a town now in our occupation, declared
that the civils, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ou peut&ecirc;tre les militaires en
civil,</span>” had fired on the troops; the parenthesis
damns its authors beyond redemption. And when
all other tests fail, when every international convention
has been repudiated, there still remains the
elementary rule, which not only jurists but soldiers
have always emphasized, that in reprisals and retribution
there should always be some <em>proportion</em> between
the offence and its punishment. What then
is to be thought of the admission of a German soldier
that sixty villagers, including women in travail,
were shot “because,” he adds laconically, “they had
telephoned to the enemy”? The critic who carefully
collates the diaries, published and unpublished, will
find overwhelming evidence of indiscriminate and
lawless butchery&mdash;“<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Befehl ergangen s&auml;mtliche m&auml;nnliche
Personen zu erschiessen.... Ein schrecklicher
Sonntag</span>” (Order passed to shoot all the male inhabitants....
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
A frightful Sunday); “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ein schreckliches
Blutbad</span>” (A frightful blood-bath); “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">S&auml;mtliche
Rechtsnormen sind aufgel&ouml;st</span>” (All the rules
of law are cast to the winds). And nothing is more
instructive than to observe how each lays the blame
for the worst outrages upon the other, while incidentally
admitting those of his own unit. One says,
“It’s the infantry who are to blame”; another says,
“The pioneers are the worst and those brigands of
artillerymen”; a third writes, “It’s all the fault of
the transport.” The cumulative effect of these recriminations
is to inculpate the whole.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a></p>

<h4>German Credibility.</h4>

<p>Quite apart from this inductive evidence there is
the fact that the German Government is so tainted
with the infamy of indisputable mendacity that no
sober and impartial man can credit a single word of
what it says. It has deliberately forged Belgian
documents which have come into its possession in
order to make out a case against the Belgian Government;<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>
it has repeatedly broken faith with the
British Government and the Vatican;<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> it has abused
the Geneva Convention in order to make use of a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
hospital ship as an instrument of war.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> Berlin itself
is one great factory of lies, and its official Press service,
to quote the words of our Ambassador, “a vast
system of international blackmail.”<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> As is the
Government, so are the people. Its merchants forge
manifests and falsify bills of lading in order to
secure the immunity of their property from capture
at sea.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> A journal under German control<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> has
admitted that the stories of mutilation so industriously
circulated by the German Government and its agents
are entirely the product of hysterical “suggestion.”
Often its pretexts are a shameless afterthought. In
co-operation with the French authorities I was instrumental
in tracking down a now notorious order
issued by a German Brigadier-General to butcher
all the wounded who fell into German hands. At
first its authenticity was denied by the German Government,
but, when it was established beyond doubt,
they published a statement that a similar order had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
been issued by one of our own Generals some twelve
months ago. The excuse was as belated as it was
mendacious, and to this day not the slightest proof
has been adduced in support of it.</p>

<p>The German authorities seem to suffer from a malady
which can only be described as moral perversion.
It is a kind of moral insanity. In defending
the sinking of the <em>Lusitania</em> with its freight of innocent
women and children the German Government
wrote:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The case of the <em>Lusitania</em> shows <em>with horrible clearness</em> to
what jeopardising of human lives the manner of war conducted
by our adversaries leads.”<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a></p></blockquote>

<p>This affectation of horror at the consequences of
its own crimes and the imputation of the guilt of
them to others is surely one of the most remarkable
revelations of the moral obliquity of the German
mind. Yet it by no means stands alone. The Proclamations,
issued in Belgium, threaten the inhabitants
with fire and sword, the scaffold and the firing-party,
for the least infraction of the most trivial
regulations, and then conclude with the aspersion
that by such infraction they will commit “the horrible
crime” of compromising the existence of a
whole community and placing it “outside the pale
of international law.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The man who omits to put
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
his hands up with acrobatic promptitude will “make
himself guilty” of the penalty of death. All through
the German utterances there runs an infatuated obsession
that the Germans enjoy a kind of moral prerogative
in virtue of which they are entitled to violate
all the laws which they rigidly prescribe for
others.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a> We have lately had an example of this
which is of supreme horror. The Power which has
broken all laws, human and divine, sought to dignify
its condemnation of Edith Cavell with all the pomp
and circumstance of a tribunal of justice. While
thousands of ravishers and spoilers go free, one
woman, who had spent her life in ministries to such
as were sick and afflicted, was handed over to the
executioner. Truly, there has been no such trial in
history since Barabbas was released and Christ led
forth to the hill of Calvary.</p>

<h4>The Guilt of the German People.</h4>

<p>It is the fondest of delusions to imagine that all
this blood-guiltiness is confined to the German Government
and the General Staff. The whole people
is stained with it. The innumerable diaries of common
soldiers in the ranks which I have read betray
a common sentiment of hate, rapine, and ferocious
credulity.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> Again and again English soldiers have
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
told me how their German captors delighted to offer
them food in their famished state and then to snatch
it away again. The progress of French, British, and
Russian prisoners, civil as well as military, through
Germany has been a veritable Calvary.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> The helplessness
which in others would excite forbearance if
not pity has in the German populace provoked only
derision and insult.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a> The “old gentleman with a
grey beard and gold spectacles” who broke his umbrella
over the back of a Russian lady (the wife of
a diplomatist), the loafers who boarded a train and
under the eyes of the indulgent sentries poked their
fingers in the blind eye of a wounded Irishman who
had had half his face shot away, the men and women
who spat upon helpless prisoners and threatened
them with death, the guards who prodded them with
bayonets, worried them with dogs, and dispatched
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
those who could not keep up&mdash;these were not a Prussian
caste, but the German people. What is to be
thought of a people, one of whose leading journals
publishes<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> with approval the letter of a German
officer describing “the brilliant idea” (ein guter
Gedanke) which inspired him to place civilians on
chairs in the middle of the street of a town attacked
by the French and use them as a screen for his men,
in spite of their “prayers of anguish.”</p>

<h4>New Russian Evidence.</h4>

<p>This question of the culpability of the German
people, civilians and soldiers in the ranks, as distinct
from the German Government, is one of supreme
importance, and I would like to draw the reader’s
attention to the mass of unpublished evidence (from
which some selections are given in Part VI. of the
Documentary Chapter of this book) placed at my disposal
by the Russian Embassy. In addition to the
documents I have printed in that chapter&mdash;I refer
the reader to No. 7 in particular&mdash;I will here quote
the following unpublished deposition as to the conduct
of the German guards in a prison camp. These
barbarities, it should be remembered, were not done
in the heat of action, but represent the leisurely
amusement of guards whose only provocation was the
helplessness of the famished men in their charge.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“In their leisure moments the German soldiers amused themselves
with practical joking at the expense of the prisoners.
They announced that an extra portion of food would be given
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
out, and when the Russians hurried to the kitchen, a whole pack
of dogs were let loose on them. The animals flew at the prisoners
and dispersed them in all directions, while the Germans
looked on and roared with laughter. Sometimes the prisoners
were offered an extra ladle of soup, or piece of bread if they
would expose their backs to a certain number of blows with a
whip. Our hungry and tormented soldiers often bought an
extra piece of bread at this price, and it was thrown to them
as if they had been dogs.”</p></blockquote>

<p>The Germans appear in the case of the Russian, as
in that of the British, Belgian, and French prisoners,
to have taken a malignant and bestial delight in outraging
their feelings of self-respect, and men were
herded together day and night in cattle-trucks deep
in manure, and forced to perform their natural functions
where they stood, packed together so close that
they could not sit and dared not lie down. At each
station they were exhibited like a travelling menagerie
to the curiosity and insult of the populace. The
quality of mercy was not shown even where one might
most expect to find it, namely, at the hands of the
German surgeons and nurses who wore the Red Cross.
Here is the deposition of Vasili Tretiakov:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Having received no food for two days, the Russian prisoners,
who fully expected to get some bread at this station, were
gazing with hungry and longing looks into the distance, when
they saw women dressed as Sisters of Mercy distributing bread
and sausages to the German soldiers. One of these Sisters went
up to the truck in which I was standing, and a Russian soldier
at the door stretched out his hand for something to eat, but the
woman simply struck it and smeared the soldier’s face with
a piece of sausage. She then called all the prisoners ‘Russian
swine’ and went away from the side of the train.”</p></blockquote>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span></p>

<p>Well may the Russian Government say in their
covering communication that “the forms of punishment”&mdash;if
we can speak of punishment when no offence
had been committed&mdash;“remind one of the tortures
of the Middle Ages.” Other documents in my
possession recite how the prisoners were harnessed to
ploughs and carts, like cattle, and lashed with long
leather whips; how a man who fainted from exhaustion
was immediately bayoneted, while another who
fell out of the ranks to pick up a rotten turnip shared
a like fate; how wounded men were forced to stand
naked for hours in the frost until gangrene set in,
tied up for hours to posts with their toes just touching
the ground until, the blood rising to the head,
copious h&aelig;morrhage took place from the nose, mouth,
and ears; how yet others who, exhausted with hunger
and fatigue, could not keep up on the march were
bayoneted or clubbed where they lay. As for the
conduct of the German populace let the following
speak for itself:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“The peaceful inhabitants along the routes traversed in
Germany showed the greatest hostility towards the prisoners,
whom they reviled as ‘Russian swine and dogs.’ Women and
even children threw stones and sand at them, and spat right
in their faces.... Even the wounded men were not spared by
these demented Germans who struck them, pulled their moustaches,
and spat in their faces.”</p></blockquote>

<h4>The German Ideal&mdash;Europe in Chains.</h4>

<p>The conception of the educated classes of Germany
as to the future of Europe we have on record: it is to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
be a tributary Europe, vast satrapies of subject populations
more rightless than the medi&aelig;val villein, their
language proscribed, their liberties disfranchised,
their commerce prohibited, their lands expropriated,
hewers of wood and drawers of water for the conqueror.
The ill-disguised slavery under which Belgium<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a>
and the occupied French Departments<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a>
groan to-day is to be perpetuated. The small nations
of Europe are to exchange the protection of Europe
for the suzerainty of Germany and to live under the
German “shield.” Their territories are to be to
Germany what the provinces were to Rome at her
worst&mdash;great praedial estates, the peasantry of which
are either to be “cleared” or to remain as the menials
of the conqueror. The German dream is the dream
of the Latin historian who sighed for more provinces
to conquer in order that liberty might be “banished
from the sight”<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> of those already under his heel.
What Germany cannot annex she will ruin, so that
borne down by heavy indemnities France shall never
be able to lift her head again. Such are the “terms
of peace” proclaimed by the German Professors, a
body of men who, it should be remembered, in Germany
hold their chairs at the pleasure of the State
and are, in fact, a branch of the Civil Service. They
therefore speak as men having authority.<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a>
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<h4>A Moral Distemper.</h4>

<p>I have been told that there are still some individuals
in England who cherish the idea that this vast
orgy of blood, lust, rapine, hate, and pride is in some
peculiar way merely the <em>Bacchanalia</em> of troops unused
to the heady bouquet of the wines of Champagne
or, stranger still, that it is the mental aberration
of a people seduced by idle tales into these
courses by its rulers. It is no part of my task to
find explanations. But if the reader is astonished,
as well he may be, at the disgusting repetition of
stories of rape and sodomy let him study the statistics
of crime in Germany during the first decade of
this century, issued by the Imperial Government; he
will find in them much to confirm the impression that
the whole people is infected with some kind of moral
distemper.<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> The seduction of a people by its rulers
is impossible; such hypnotic susceptibility to the influences
of “suggestion” would, of itself, be a symptom
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
of mental degeneration in the people itself. It
is impossible to believe that the most highly educated
nation in Europe is either so ignorant or so credulous
as such an explanation would suggest. It is not in
their ignorance but in their turpitude that the clue
to these barbarities is to be found. This is a sombre
fact which has to be faced or these appalling records
will have been sifted and published in vain. The
problem of explanation is ultimately one for the anthropologist
rather than the lawyer, and there may be
force in the contention of those who believe that the
Prussian is not a member of the Teutonic family at
all, but a “throw-back” to some Tartar stock. Certain
it is that he exhibits an insensibility to the feelings
of others which is only equalled by his extreme
sensitiveness as to his own.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a> This morbid insensibility
is, of course, the secret of German “Terrorism,”
and of the immense influence which it has exerted
on the theory and practice of war among the German
nation. It explains their singular ingenuity in finding
means to an end, and between the German trooper
who dips a baby’s head into scalding water in order
to get more coffee from its mother<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a> to the commandant
who at the point of the bayonet thrusts a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
living screen of priests, old men, and women with
babes at the breast<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> between his own troops and
those of the enemy there is a difference of degree
rather than of kind. Similarly the dark passage in
the German War Book which hints that there may be
occasions on which it will be profitable to massacre
prisoners of war reveals the same quality of mind as
the order to shoot helpless sailors who are struggling
for their lives in the sea.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> All things are lawful
which are expedient, and if your enemy has ties of
affection, the better he lends himself to your belligerent
exploitation. <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mentem mortalia tangunt</em>&mdash;human
things touch the heart&mdash;acquires for the German Staff
a new and sinister significance. Every tender feeling
that their enemy has becomes a hostage for his tractability,
because it can be violated if he is contumacious.
His churches can be profaned, his priests murdered,
his boys driven into exile, his women-folk
handed over to the lust of a licentious soldiery, and
his home destroyed. If his troops defeat one in the
field, the civilian population can be made to pay for
it with their lives,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a> so that eventually he may be disarmed
not by defeat but by horror. His own humanity
will be his undoing. Not fear but anguish will
bring him to his knees.</p>

<p>This is the German doctrine, secreted in the pages
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
of many a German manual,<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> and now published to
the world in the German Proclamations and the evil
deeds which they both excuse and provoke. This it
is which has made the German nation, in the words
of Lord Rosebery, “the enemy of the human race,”
and has caused the very name of this bestial and
servile people to stink in the nostrils of mankind.</p>

<h3 id="THE_FUTURE_OF_INTERNATIONAL_LAW_AND_THE_QUESTION_OF_RETRIBUTION">IV<br />

THE FUTURE OF INTERNATIONAL LAW AND THE QUESTION
OF RETRIBUTION</h3>

<h4>The Dissolution of Europe.</h4>

<p>Many years ago the most distinguished of the modern
school of French historians wrote a remarkable
essay on the subject of “Diplomacy and Progress.”<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
He knew Europe as few had known it; he had spent
his life in its chancelleries and its archives, and his
wisdom was only equalled by his knowledge, for he
had studied not only books but men. In that essay
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
he speculated as to the effect of the progress of mechanical
invention in the arts of war upon the prospects
of European peace, and he confessed to a
mournful depression. But the source of his apprehension
was not Europe but Asia. He foresaw the
possibility of some potent Oriental nation awaking
from its secular meditations and applying itself in a
single generation to an apprenticeship in those mechanical
arts which are no longer the peculiar mystery
and the prerogative of the Western world. A
nation thus acquiring the destructive resources of
the West, while retaining the peculiar morality of the
East&mdash;its ruthlessness, its contempt for human life,
its sombre fatalism, its indifference to personal liberty,
its chicanery, its love of espionage&mdash;might, he
apprehended, fall upon Europe in a catastrophic
assault as unforeseen as it would be unprovoked, and
threaten her with destruction.</p>

<p>The catastrophe has fallen, but the foes of Europe
have been those of her own household, and we have
discovered with a shock of dismay that the comity of
European nations has harboured a Power which is
European in nothing but in name, and is more completely
alien to Western ideals than the tribes of Afghanistan.
A hybrid nation of this type which is intellectual
without being refined, which can discipline
its mind but cannot control its appetites, which can
acquire the idiom of Europe and yet retain the instincts
of Asia or rather of some pre-Asiatic horde,
presents the greatest problem that has ever perplexed
the civilisation of man. It is like an intellectual
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
savage who has learnt the language and studied the
dress and deportment of polite society, but all the
while nurtures dark atavisms and murderous impulses
in the centres of his brain. The subtle danger
of the presence of such a nation in the European
comity is that it uses the language of that international
society, and yet all the while means something
different, and that with every appearance of solemn
subscription to its forms and treaties it is making
mental reservations and “economies” which strike
at the very root of them.</p>

<h4>The Casuistry of the Intellectual Savage.</h4>

<p>In the hands of such a nation an international convention
is not merely idle and impotent; the convention
itself becomes positively dangerous, simply because
it can be perverted. It can be used to invest
the most barbarous acts with a specious plausibility,
and can be turned against the very people whom it
was designed to protect. Any one who takes the
trouble to study the official proclamations of the
German military authorities, or the introductory
memorandum to the German White Book, cannot fail
to be struck by this. A civilian who fires on the enemy
forfeits under international law the privileges
of a non-combatant. The rule means as much as it
says, and no more; it does not impose on a civil community
the obligation to prove that it is a non-combatant.
But in nine out of ten German proclamations
the rule is invoked as an excuse for involving
a whole community in responsibility with their lives
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
for the acts or omissions, real or alleged, of single individuals&mdash;“the
innocent will suffer with the
guilty”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a>&mdash;and the “law of nations” is invoked to
put a whole population “outside the pale” of it.<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>
At one stroke we are carried back to the days of the
blood-feud and of vicarious punishment, and the law
of nations is perverted from an instrument of progress
to an organon of bloody sophistries. So, too,
the Hague Convention which requires that requisitions
of supplies should not be made without giving
receipts is observed in the letter and violated in the
spirit; receipts are given, but they are forged. The
obligation of a treaty guaranteeing the neutrality of
Belgium is admitted, but a false charge and a falsified
document is advanced to justify its breach. A brigade
order to kill all prisoners is first denied, and
then when denial becomes futile, a fictitious order of
a prior date is alleged against us in order to dignify
the real order with the sanction of “reprisals.” Defenceless
merchantmen are attacked and sunk at
first sight, and then when they carry guns for their
protection their precautions for defence are used as
a retrospective pretext for attack. The same curious
casuistry is invoked to excuse the attacks on Scarborough
and London, and the Hague Convention is
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span>
interpreted, in defiance of its authors, to support the
plea that whatever barbarity is not expressly prohibited
is thereby condoned.</p>

<h4>Germany as a Moral Pervert.</h4>

<p>It is this terrible perversion, this prostitution of
words until, to quote a classical expression of Thucydides,
they have lost their meaning in relation to
things, that seems to me the most intractable problem
that we have to face. To my mind it is this pathological
aspect of the German temperament which presents
a far more serious obstacle to a restoration of
the European comity based on the readmission of
Germany to membership than the German dogma of
war. You may, perhaps, extirpate a dogma but you
cannot alter a temperament. To regard Germany
as the misguided pupil of a military caste which alone
stands in the way of her reformation seems to me to
ignore the volume of evidence as to the complicity of
officers and men in those orgies of outrage. I cannot
avoid the conclusion that the whole people is infected
with a kind of moral distemper.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“Look, Madame,” said a German soldier to a French woman
who witnessed the execution of three poor travellers who with
their hands tied behind their backs with napkins were led into
a field close to her house and shot by six soldiers under the command
of a German officer, “Look! isn’t it fine! See them
shoot some French civilians. A fine feat that! All the others
ought to be killed in the same way.”<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The sentiment is typical; German diaries are full
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
of such things. Nor is it reasonable to suppose that
the kind of teaching which has made Clausewitz and
Treitschke and Bernhardi the gospel of the German
people, and has found authoritative expression in the
German War Book, could have commanded the prestige
which it does command in Germany if it had not
found a people apt and eager by temperament to receive
it. Germany stands alone among modern nations
in extending its official conception, and even its
academic analysis<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> of war, to include the deliberate
“terrorization” of non-combatants. She alone has
taught, both by precept and example, that there are
no limitations to what is justifiable by the exigencies
of war. “<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">C’est la guerre</em>” is the common answer of
German officers when implored by the victims to stop
the lust and rapine of their men.<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> It follows from
all this that war as taught and practised by the Germans
exceeds in savagery even the practices of the
ancient world, in which it was thought the mark of
barbarism to poison wells, desecrate temples and murder
priests&mdash;practices which the Germans have not
hesitated to pursue. Incitement to assassination,
which was thought a mean and dishonourable thing
by the Roman mind,<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> is specifically recommended in
the German War Book.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>

<p>In the ancient world the vanquished were regarded
as rightless, and whole populations were sold into
slavery after they had been decimated by the slaughter
of their leading citizens. The German practice
is not intrinsically different; municipal magistrates,
parish priests, and one in three of the civil population
have been butchered, many civilians carried off to
Germany to work in the fields, and those who are left
behind forced to dig trenches for their captors while
their wives and daughters are handed over to the lust
of the soldiery, and their movable property transported.
It is difficult to see how this differs in anything
but name from the tragic fate of those unhappy
communities who in the laconic phrase of the ancient
world passed <em lang="es" xml:lang="es">sub corona</em> and were sold by auction.
All this differs from the practices of the ancient
world in nothing except a certain affectation, the one
concession to modern sentiment being a studious defamation
by the Germans of the people whom they
ravish and despoil. It seems to me that bad as the
German crimes are the German justification for them
is even worse. For it betrays a real corruption of
mind. The ancients were often brutal but they were
never hypocritical.</p>

<h4>The Bankruptcy of The Hague Conventions.</h4>

<p>What hope then can there be of a restoration of the
comity of European nations, and the re-establishment
of the Hague Conventions? I confess I can see none.
The German Empire was conceived in duplicity and
brought forth in war, and three times within living
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span>
memory, as Sir Edward Grey has reminded us, she
has wantonly provoked war in Europe in pursuance
of her predatory designs. I can see no way out of
the present travail except an armed peace, with the
elimination as its basis for a long time to come of
Germany from the councils of Europe. What hope
of understanding can there be with a nation which
does not observe the ordinary rules of diplomatic
intercourse, that <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">jus fetiale</em> which even the ancient
world regarded as sacred? The world has seen with
stupefaction&mdash;there has, I think, been no such case
for hundreds of years&mdash;the Ambassador of the Austrian
Government taking advantage of his immunities
and sovereign character to suborn seditious conspiracy
in the State to which he was accredited?<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a> It
is difficult to believe that this case now stands alone.
Conventions with such a Power are both a delusion
and a snare. They delude us with an appearance of
agreement where none exists. In unscrupulous
hands, the more precise and technical they are, the
more do they lend themselves to casuistry, adding,
as some one has said, the terrors of law to the horrors
of war. I am afraid that such conventions are now
hopelessly discredited. I doubt if we shall hear very
much in future of the distinction between combatants
and non-combatants, or of the sanctity of the
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">lev&eacute;e en masse</em> as a medium of lawful transition
from the one to the other; he who studies the German
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
White Book on hostilities in Belgium will see how
easily a belligerent, if he be so minded, can dispose
with a quibble of the obligations to respect an improvised
force which has “no time” to organise. A
belligerent contemplating a sudden attack and a belligerent
having to meet it will entertain very different
conceptions as to what is meant by “no time.” War
has, indeed, come to be, as von der Goltz prophesied
it would be, a war not between armies but between
peoples, and we are further than ever from the oft-quoted
maxim of Rousseau that “War is not a relation
of Man to Man but of States to States,” in which
particular individuals are enemies only by the accident
of a uniform. That was the voice of Individualism;
but States grow more and more collectivist,
and never so collectivist as in war. If, as an eminent
writer has remarked, “out of the inner life of a nation
comes its foreign policy,” so, we may add, out
of its municipal law, its military usages, and its economic
necessities will come its construction of international
law.</p>

<h4>The Effect on International Law.</h4>

<p>It surely cannot be too clearly recognised that
Germany’s successive violations of the laws of war
have brought the whole fabric down like a house of
cards. When the Germans began to sink neutral
merchantmen by way of vindicating what they were
pleased to call the freedom of the seas, England was
forced to jettison much of that famous Declaration
of London, which seemed at one time to be as complete
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
an expression of a consensus of international
opinion as the world of jurists had yet attained. We
have gone further, as we were bound to do, and have
so extended the theory of blockade as to qualify very
considerably the Declaration of Paris. The Foreign
Office has supported these departures by the logic of
reprisals&mdash;in my humble opinion very properly&mdash;but
“reprisals” are, juridically speaking, a kind of counsel
of despair. In books on international law they
receive a kind of shame-faced recognition; their place
is always at the end and the chapter devoted to them
is often brief and generally apologetic. For the jurist
knows that they partake of the character of law about
as much as trial by battle. The voice of America is a
voice crying in the wilderness; both groups of belligerents
deny the American contention that peace,
and with it the commerce of neutrals, should govern
the construction of the rules of war. How can it be
otherwise in a struggle for existence? I very much
doubt whether, for a long time to come, international
lawyers can afford to assume, as they have been in the
habit of doing, that peace, not war, is the normal conditions
of nations. A nation which like Germany will
not admit your major premises will certainly reject
your conclusions when it suits her convenience. The
dilemma therefore is inexorable: we can readmit Germany
to international society and lower our standard
of International Law to her level, or we can exclude
her and raise it. There is no third course.</p>

<p>These are the hard facts to which any one who attempts
to take stock of the present situation and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
immediate prospects of International Law must
address himself. International Law rests on a reciprocity
of obligation; if one belligerent fails to
observe it the other is, as a mere matter of self-preservation,
released from its observance towards
him, and is bound not by law but by morality, by his
own conception of what he owes to his own self-respect.
It is well that our own conception has
been rather in advance of International Law
than behind it, and long may it so remain.
But in proportion as our conception is high
and the German conception is low, it seems to me
incumbent on us to place our hopes for the future
in the strength of our right arm and in that alone.
And if, in Burke’s noble phrase, we are to consider
ourselves for the future “embodied with Europe” so
that, sympathetic with the adversity or the happiness
of mankind, we feel that nothing human is alien to
us, then we must be prepared to support our treaty
guarantees of the independence of the small nations
with an adequate armed force; otherwise they will regard
our friendship as an equivocal and compromising
thing. If we are to offer them the protection of
Europe in place of the suzerainty of Germany, we
must be in a position to honour our promissory notes
or they will indeed be but a scrap of paper&mdash;a cruel
and otiose encouragement to the weak to defy the
strong.</p>

<h4>The German as Outlaw.</h4>

<p>As for Germany, I can see little hope except in a
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
sentence of outlawry. Mere black-listing of the
names of responsible German commanders, although
worth doing (and I have reason to believe that at the
French War Office it is being done) with a view to
retribution, is not going to change the German character.
We shall have to revise our notions of both
municipal and international law as regards her. The
tendency of English law has long been, as an acute
jurist has pointed out,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> to lay more emphasis on
domicile than on nationality, the disabilities of the
alien have been diminished almost to vanishing-point,
and British citizenship itself could be had almost for
the asking. Not of it need the alien knocking at our
hospitable doors say, in the words of the chief captain,
“With a great sum obtained I this freedom.”
It has been made disastrously cheap. All that is
likely to be changed. It is not a little significant that
already the courts have begun to take judicial notice
of the peculiar morality of the German and have
expressly made it the basis of a decision extending the
conception of what constitutes a prisoner of war.<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>
And alone among the emergency legislation the drastic
Aliens Act is not limited in its preamble, as are
the other Acts, to the duration of the war. These
things are portents. It is impossible to believe that
a revolution more catastrophic than anything through
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
which Europe has passed, a revolution beside which
the French Revolution assumes the proportions of a
storm in a tea-cup, can leave our conceptions of law,
whether municipal or international, unchanged.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<h4>Conclusion.</h4>

<p>I make no apology, and I trust that none is needed,
for these speculations. Reports of atrocities can
serve no useful purpose unless they move men to reflect
no less resolutely than deeply upon what is to
be done to deliver Europe from the scourge of their
repetition. It may well be that my own reflections
will seem cynical to one, depressing to another, arbitrary
to a third. They are not the idols of the theatre,
and in academic circles they may not be fashionable.
But the catastrophe that has disturbed the
dreams of the idealogues must teach jurists and statesmen
to beware of the opiate of words and sacramental
phrases. That, however, is a task which belongs to
the future. The immediate enterprise is not for lawyers
but for our gallant men in the field. They, and
they alone, can lay the foundations of an enduring
peace by an unremitting and inexorable war. They
are the true ministers of justice.

<h2 id="THE_BRITISH_ENQUIRY_IN_FRANCE"><span class="smcap">Chapter II</span><br />

THE BRITISH ENQUIRY IN FRANCE</h2>

<p><span class="smcap">In</span> November of last year I was commissioned by the
Secretary of State for Home Affairs to undertake the
investigation in France into the alleged breaches of
the laws of war by the German troops, the inquiries
in England being separately conducted by others.
The results of my investigation were communicated
to the Home Office, in the form of confidential reports
and of depositions, diaries, proclamations, and other
<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pi&egrave;ces justificatives</em>, and were in turn submitted to
the Committee appointed by the Prime Minister and
presided over by Lord Bryce. The Committee made
liberal use of this material, but, owing to the exigencies
of space and the necessity of selection, some
of it remains unpublished, and I now propose to place
it and the conclusions I draw from it before the public.
Some part of it, and that part the most important&mdash;namely,
that which establishes proofs of a deliberate
policy of atrocity by responsible German officers&mdash;came
into my hands too late for use by the Committee.
Moreover, the Committee felt that their first
duty was to Belgium, and consequently the portion
of the inquiry which related to France, and in particular
to outrages upon British soldiers in France,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
occupies a comparatively small place in their publications.
In this article I therefore confine myself to
the latter branch of the inquiry, and the reader will
understand that, except where otherwise stated, the
documents here set out are now published for the
first time.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a></p>

<p>My investigations extended over a period of four
or five months. The first six weeks were spent in
visiting the base hospitals and convalescent camps
at Boulogne and Rouen, and the hospitals at Paris;
during the remaining three months I was attached to
the General Headquarters Staff of the British Expeditionary
Force. In the course of my inquiries in the
hospitals and camps I orally interrogated some two
or three thousand officers and soldiers,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> representing
almost every regiment in the British armies and all
of whom had recently been engaged on active service
in the field. The whole of these inquiries were conducted
by me personally, but my inquiries at headquarters
were of a much more systematic character.
There, owing to the courtesy of Lieutenant-General
Sir Archibald Murray, the late Chief of the General
Staff, I had the assistance of the various services&mdash;in
particular the Adjutant-General, the Provost-Marshal,
the Director of Military Intelligence, the Director
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span>
of Medical Services and their respective staffs&mdash;and
also of the civil authorities, within the area at
present occupied by the British armies, such as the
sous-prefets, the procureurs de la R&eacute;publique, the
commissaries de police, and the maires of the communes.
In this way I was enabled not only to obtain
corroboration of the statements taken down in the
base hospitals in the earlier stages of my inquiry, but
also to make a close local study of the behaviour of
the German troops towards the civil population during
their occupation of the districts recently evacuated
by them.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a> In pursuance of this latter inquiry
I visited every town and commune of any importance
now in our occupation and lately occupied by the
Germans, including places within a few hundred
yards of the German lines. As regards the conduct
of the German troops in the earlier stages of the campaign
and in other parts of France, I confined my
inquiries to incidents which actually came under the
observation of our own troops during or after the
battles of Mons, the Marne, and the Aisne, and did
not extend them to include the testimony of the
French civil authorities, as I did not consider it part
of my duty to attempt to do what was already being
done by the Commission of Inquiry instituted by the
President of the Council. But I freely availed myself
of opportunities of corroboration of English evidence
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
from French sources where such sources were
readily accessible, and, by the courtesy of the French
Ministry of War, who placed a Staff officer and a military
car at my disposal, I was enabled to go over the
ground to the north-east of Paris covered by our troops
in their advance to the Aisne and to obtain confirmation
of many incidents already related to me by
British officers and soldiers. It was also my privilege
frequently to meet M. Mollard, of the French Commission,
and to examine for myself the depositions
on oath and <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">pi&egrave;ces justificatives</em> on which the first
Reports of the Commission are based, and which are
as yet unpublished. In these different ways I have
been enabled to obtain an extensive view of the whole
field of inquiry and to arrive at certain general conclusions
which may be of some value.</p>

<h3 id="METHODS_OF_ENQUIRY">Methods of Enquiry.</h3>

<p>My method of inquiry was twofold&mdash;I availed myself
of both oral evidence and written evidence. As
regards the former, the evidence taken at the base
hospitals was wholly of this character. The method
which I adopted in taking it was as follows:</p>

<p>I made it a rule to explain to the soldier or officer
at the outset that the inquiry was an official one, and
that he must be prepared to put his name to any testimony
he might elect to give.</p>

<p>I allowed the soldier to tell his story in his own
way and in his own words, but after, or in the course
of, the recital, I always cross-examined him as to
details, inquiring in particular (1) whether he directly
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
witnessed the event himself; (2) what was the
date and place of the occurrence&mdash;to establish these
I have frequently gone over the operations with the
witness with the aid of a military map and a diary
of the campaign; (3) whether, in the case of hearsay
evidence, he heard the story direct from the subject
of it, and, in particular, whether he was versed in
the language employed; (4) whether he could give
me the name of any person or persons with him, particularly
officers, who also witnessed the event or
heard the story.</p>

<p>After such cross-examination I then took down the
narrative, if satisfied that it possessed any value, read
it over to the soldier, and then obtained his signature.
This, however, was often only the first stage, as I
have not infrequently been able to obtain confirmation
of the evidence so obtained by subsequent inquiries
at General or Divisional Headquarters, either
among members of the staff or from company officers
or from the civil authorities. For example, hearsay
evidence of rape (and I always regarded such evidence
as inconclusive of itself) tendered to me by
soldiers at the base hospitals received very striking
confirmation in the depositions of the victims on oath
which had been taken by the civil authorities at Bailleul,
Metteren, and elsewhere, and which were subsequently
placed at my disposal. Personal inquiries
made by me among the maires and cur&eacute;s of the communes
where particular incidents were alleged to
have occurred resulted in similar confirmation. So,
too, the Indian witnesses whom I examined at the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
base hospital were at my request subsequently re-examined,
when they had rejoined their units, by the
Intelligence Officers attached to the Indian Corps,
and with much the same results. Corroborative evidence
as to a policy of discrimination practised by
the German officers in favour of Indians was also obtained
from the record of statements volunteered by
a German prisoner of the 112th Regiment and placed
at my disposal by our Intelligence Officers.</p>

<p>The general impression left in my mind by these
subsequent inquiries at head-quarters as to the value
of the statements made to me earlier by soldiers in
hospital is that those statements were true. There
is a tendency in some quarters to depreciate the value
of the testimony of the British soldier, but the degree
of its value depends a good deal on the capacity in
which, and the person to whom, the soldier is addressing
himself. In writing letters home or in talking to
solicitous visitors the soldier is one person; in giving
evidence in an official inquiry he is quite another. I
have had opportunities when attending field courts-martial
of seeing something of the way in which soldiers
give evidence, and I see no reason to suppose
that the soldier is any less reliable than the average
civilian witness in a court of common law. Indeed,
the moment I made it clear to the soldiers that my inquiry
was an official one they became very cautious
and deliberate in their statements, often correcting
themselves or referring to their diaries (of which they
usually take great care), or qualifying the narration
with the statement “I did not see it myself.” It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
need hardly be said that these observations as to the
credibility of the soldiers apply no less to that of the
officers. And it is worthy of remark that, apart from
individual cases of corroboration of a soldier’s evidence
by that of an officer, the burden of the evidence
in the case of each class is the same. Where
officers do not testify to the same thing as the soldiers,
they testify to similar things. The cumulative effect
produced on my mind is that of uniform experience.</p>

<p>I have often found the statements so made subsequently
corroborated; I have rarely, if ever, found
them contradicted. I ascribe this result to my having
applied rigid rules as to the reception of evidence in
the first instance. I have always taken into account
the peculiar receptivity of minds fatigued and overwrought
by the strain of battle to the influences of
“suggestion,” whether in the form of newspapers or
of oral gossip. It sometimes, but not often, happened
that one could recognise the same story in a different
investiture, although appearing at first sight to be a
different occurrence. Or, again, it may happen that
a story undergoes elaboration in the process of transmission
until it looks worse than it originally was.
So, too, a case of apparent outrage may admit of
several explanations; it may happen, for example, in
the case of a suspicious use of the white flag that the
act of one party of Germans in raising it and of another
party in taking advantage of it were conceivably
independent of one another. Cases of the shelling
of “undefended” places, of churches, and of hospitals,
I have always disregarded if our men or guns
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
were or lately had been in the vicinity; and it may
easily happen that a case of firing on stretcher-bearers
or ambulance waggons is due to the impossibility of
discrimination in the midst of a general engagement.
Wherever any of these features appeared to be present
I rejected the evidence&mdash;not always nor necessarily
because I doubted its veracity, but because I
had misgivings as to its value.</p>

<h3 id="OUTRAGES_UPON_COMBATANTS_IN_THE_FIELD">Outrages upon Combatants in the Field.</h3>

<p>Lord Bryce’s Committee, with that scrupulous fairness
which so honourably distinguishes their Report,
have stated that:</p>

<p>“We have no evidence to show whether and in
what cases orders proceeded from the officer in command
to give no quarter, but there are some instances
in which persons obviously desiring to surrender were
nevertheless killed.”</p>

<p>This is putting the case with extreme moderation,
as the evidence at the disposal of the Committee,
showing, as it did, that such barbarities were frequently
committed when the German troops were
present in force, raised a considerable presumption
that they were authorised by company and platoon
commanders at least, if not in pursuance of brigade
orders. But after the Committee had concluded its
labours, and, unfortunately, too late for its consideration,
I succeeded, as the result of a long and patient
investigation, in obtaining evidence which establishes
beyond reasonable doubt that the outrages upon combatants
in the field were committed by the express
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
orders of responsible officers such as brigade and company
commanders. The nature of that evidence
(which is here published for the first time) I will
disclose in a moment. But before doing so I will present
the conclusions I had previously arrived at by a
process of induction from individual cases. It will
then be seen how the deductive method of proof from
the evidence of general orders confirms the presumption
raised by the evidence of particular instances.</p>

<p>A German military writer of great authority<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a> predicted
some years ago that the next war would be
one of inconceivable violence. The prophecy appears
only too true as regards the conduct of German
troops in the field; it has rarely been distinguished
by that chivalry which is supposed to characterise
the freemasonry of arms. One of our most distinguished
Staff officers remarked to me that the Germans
have no sense of honour in the field, and the
almost uniform testimony of our officers and men induces
me to believe that the remark is only too true.
Abuse of the white flag has been very frequent, especially
in the earlier stages of the campaign on the
Aisne, when our officers, not having been disillusioned
by bitter experience, acted on the assumption that
they had to deal with an honourable opponent.
Again and again the white flag was put up, and when
a company of ours advanced unsuspectingly and without
supports to take prisoners, the Germans who had
exhibited the token of surrender parted their ranks
to make room for a murderous fire from machine-guns
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>
concealed behind them. Or, again, the flag was
exhibited in order to give time for supports to come
up. It not infrequently happened that our company
officers, advancing unarmed to confer with the German
company commander in such cases, were shot
down as they approached. The Camerons, the West
Yorks, the Coldstreams, the East Lancs, the Wiltshires,
the South Wales Borderers, in particular, suffered
heavily in these ways. In all these cases they
were the victims of organised German units, <em>i.e.</em> companies
or battalions, acting under the orders of responsible
officers.</p>

<p>There can, moreover, be no doubt that the respect
of the German troops for the Geneva Convention is
but intermittent.<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> Cases of deliberate firing on
stretcher-bearers are, according to the universal testimony
of our officers and men, of frequent occurrence.
It is almost certain death to attempt to convey
wounded men from the trenches over open ground
except under cover of night. A much more serious
offence, however, is the deliberate killing of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
wounded as they lie helpless and defenceless on the
field of battle. This is so grave a charge that were it
not substantiated by the considered statements of
officers, non-commissioned officers, and men, one
would hesitate to believe it. But even after rejecting,
as one is bound to do, cases which may be explained
by accident, mistake, or the excitement of action,
there remains a large residuum of cases which can
only be explained by deliberate malice. No other
explanation is possible when, as has not infrequently
happened, men who have been wounded by rifle fire
in an advance, and have had to be left during a retirement
for reinforcements, are discovered, in our
subsequent advance, with nine or ten bayonet wounds
or with their heads beaten in by the butt-ends of
rifles. Such cases could not have occurred, the enemy
being present in force, without the knowledge of superior
officers. Indeed, I have before me evidence
which goes to show that German officers have themselves
acted in similar fashion. Some of the cases
reveal a leisurely barbarity which proves great deliberation;
cases such as the discovery of bodies of
despatch-riders burnt with petrol or “pegged out”
with lances, or of soldiers with their faces stamped
upon by the heel of a boot, or of a guardsman found
with numerous bayonet wounds evidently inflicted as
he was in the act of applying a field dressing to a
bullet wound. There also seems no reason to doubt
the independent statements of men of the Loyal
North Lancs, whom I interrogated on different occasions,
that the men of one of their companies were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
killed on December 20th after they had surrendered
and laid down their arms.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a> To what extent prisoners
have been treated in this manner it is impossible to
say; dead men tell no tales, but an exceptionally able
Intelligence Officer at the head-quarters of the Cavalry
Corps informed me that it is believed that when
British prisoners are taken in small parties they are
put to death in cold blood. Certain it is that our men
when captured are kicked, robbed of all they possess,
threatened with death if they will not give information,
and in some cases forced to dig trenches. The
evidence I have taken from soldiers at the base hospitals
on these points is borne out by evidence taken
at the Front immediately after such occurrences by
the Deputy Judge-Advocate General, an Assistant
Provost-Marshal, and a captain in the Sherwood Foresters,
and in the opinion of these officers the evidence
which they took, and which they subsequently placed
at my disposal, is reliable.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a></p>

<h4>The Proofs of Policy.</h4>

<p>The question as to how far these outrages are attributable
to policy and superior orders becomes imperative.
It was at first difficult to answer. For a
long time I did not find, nor did I expect to find,
any documentary orders to that effect. Such orders,
if given at all, were much more likely to be verbal,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
for it is extremely improbable that the German authorities
would be so unwise as to commit them to
writing. But the outrages upon combatants were so
numerous and so collective in character that I began
to suspect policy at a very early stage in my investigations.
My suspicions were heightened by the
significant fact that exhaustive inquiries which I
made among Indian native officers and men in the
hospital ships in port at Boulogne, and at the base
hospitals, seemed to indicate that experiences of outrage
were as rare among the Indian troops as they
were common among the British. The explanation
was fairly obvious, inasmuch as many of these Indian
witnesses who had fallen into German hands testified
to me that the German officers<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a> seized the occasion
to assure them that Germany was animated by the
most friendly feelings towards them, and more than
once dismissed them with an injunction not to fight
against German troops and to bring over their comrades
to the German side. For example, a sepoy in
the 9th Bhopals testified to me as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“I and three others were found wounded by the Germans.
They bound up our wounds and invited us to join them, offering
us money and land. I answered, ‘I, who have eaten the King’s
salt, cannot do this thing and thus bring sorrow and shame
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
upon my people.’ The Germans took our chupattis, and offered
us of their bread in return. I said, ‘I am a Brahmin and cannot
touch it.’ They then left us, saying that if we were captured
again they would kill us.”</p></blockquote>

<p>There was other evidence to the same effect.
Eventually I obtained proofs confirming my suspicions,
and I will now proceed to set them out.</p>

<p>On May 3rd I visited the Ministry of War in
Paris at the invitation of the French military authorities,
and was received by M. le Capitaine Ren&eacute; Petit,
Chef de Service du Contentieux, who conducted me
to the department where the diaries of German prisoners
were kept. I made a brief preliminary examination
of them, and discovered the following passage
(which I had photographed) in the diary of a German
N.C.O., G&ouml;ttsche, of the 85th Infantry Regiment
(the IXth Corps), fourth company detached for
service, under date “Okt. 6, 1914, bei Antwerpen”:</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Der Herr Hauptmann rief uns um sich und sagte: ‘In dem
Fort, das zu nehmen ist, sind aller Wahrscheinlichkeit nach
Engl&auml;nder. Ich w&uuml;nsche aber keinen gefangenen Engl&auml;nder bei
der Komp. zu sehen.’ Ein allgemeiner Bravo der Zustimmung
war die Antwort.”</p>

<p>(“The Captain called us to him and said: ‘In the fortress
[<em>i.e.</em>, Antwerp] which we have to take there are in all probability
Englishmen. But I do not want to see any Englishmen
prisoners in the hands of this company.’ A general ‘Bravo’ of
assent was the answer.”)</p></blockquote>

<p>This malignant frenzy against British troops, so
carefully instilled, is borne out by a passage in another
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
diary, now in the possession of the French
Ministry of War, which was found on April 22nd on
the body of Richard Gerhold, of the 71st Regiment
of Infantry of the Reserve, Fourth Army Corps, who
was killed in September at Nouvron:</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Auch hier kommen ja Sachen vor, was auch nicht sein darf,
kommt aber doch vor. Grosse Greultaten kommen nat&uuml;rlich an
Engl&auml;ndern und Belgiern vor. Nun da wird eben jeder ohne
Gnaden niedergeknallt, aber wehe dem armen Deutschen der
in ihre H&auml;nde kommt....”</p>

<p>(“Here also things occur which should not be. Great atrocities
are of course committed upon Englishmen and Belgians;
every one of them is now knocked on the head without mercy.
But woe to the poor German who falls into their hands.”)</p></blockquote>

<p>As regards the last sentence in this diary, which is
one long chapter of horrors and betrays a ferocious
credulity, it is worthy of remark that I have seen at
the French Ministry of War the diary<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> of a German
N.C.O., named Schulze, who, judging by internal evidence,
was a man of exceptional intelligence, in which
the writer refers to tales of French and Belgian
atrocities circulated among the men by his superior
officers. He shrewdly adds that he believes the officers
invented these stories in order to prevent him
and his comrades from surrendering.</p>

<p>A less conclusive passage, but a none the less suspicious
one, is to be found in a diary now in my possession.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
It is the diary of an Unter-offizier, named
Ragge, of the 158th Regiment, and contains (under
date October 21st) the following:</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Wir verfolgten den Gegner soweit wir ihn sahen. Da haben
wir machen Engl&auml;nder abgeknallt. Die Engl&auml;nder lagen wie
ges&auml;ht am Boden. Die noch lebenden Engl&auml;nder im Sch&uuml;tzengraben
wurden erstochen oder erschossen. Unsere Komp.
machte 61 Gefangene.”</p></blockquote>

<p>Which may be translated:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“We pursued the enemy as far as we saw him. We ‘knocked
out’ many English. The English lay on the ground as if sown
there. Those of the Englishmen who were still alive in the
trenches were stuck or shot. Our company made 61 prisoners.”<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a></p></blockquote>

<p>So far I have only dealt with the acts of small
German units&mdash;<em>i.e.</em> companies of infantry. I now
come to the most damning proofs of a policy of coldblooded
murder of wounded and prisoners, initiated
and carried out by a whole brigade under the orders
of a Brigadier-General. This particular investigation
took me a long time, but the results are, I think conclusive.
It may be remembered that some months
ago the French military authorities published in the
French newspapers what purported to be the text
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
of an order issued by a German Brigadier-General,
named Stenger, commanding the 58th Brigade, in
which he ordered his troops to take no prisoners and
to put to death without mercy every one who fell into
their hands, whether wounded and defenceless or not.
The German Government immediately denounced the
alleged order as a forgery. I determined to see
whether I could establish its authenticity, and in February
last I obtained a copy of the original from M.
Mollard, of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, who is
a member of the Commission appointed by the French
Government to inquire into the alleged German
atrocities. The text of that order was as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Befehl (Armee-befehl) vom 26. Aug. 1914, gegen 4 Uhr
nachm. wie er von F&uuml;hrer der 7 Komp. Reg. 112 (Infant.) bei
Thionville, am Eingang des Waldes von Saint-Barbe, seinen
Truppen als Brigade-oder Armee-befehl gegeben wurde:</p>

<p lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Von heute ab werden keine Gefangene mehr gemacht S&auml;mtliche
Gefangene werden niedergemacht. Verwundete ob mit
Waffen oder wehrlos niedergemacht. Gefangene auch in gr&ouml;sseren
geschlossenen Formationen werden niedergemacht. Es
bleibt kein Mann lebend hinter uns.”</p>

<p>(“Army Order of 26 Aug., 1914, about 4 p.m., such as was
given to his troops as a Brigade or Army Order by the leader
of the 7th Company of the 112th Regiment of Infantry at
Thionville, at the entrance of the wood of Saint Barbe.</p>

<p>“To date from this day no prisoners will be made any longer.
All the prisoners will be executed. The wounded, whether
armed or defenceless, will be executed. Prisoners, even in large
and compact formations, will be executed. Not a man will be
left alive behind us.”)</p></blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span></p>

<p>Taking this alleged order as my starting-point, I
began to make inquiries at British Head-quarters as
to the existence of any information about the doings
of the 112th Regiment. I soon found that there was
good reason to suspect it. Our Intelligence Department
placed in my hands the records of the examination
of two men of this regiment who had been captured
by us. One of them volunteered a statement to
one of our Intelligence Officers on November 23rd to
the effect that his regiment had orders to treat Indians
well, but were allowed to treat British prisoners
as they pleased. This man’s testimony appeared
to be reliable, as statements he made on other points,
<em>i.e.</em>, as to the German formations, were subsequently
found to be true, and his information as to discrimination
in the treatment of Indians entirely bore out
the conclusions I had already arrived at on that particular
point. The German witness in question further
stated that 65 out of 150 British prisoners were
killed in cold blood by their escort on or about October
23rd on the road to Lille, and that the escort
were praised for their conduct. Other German prisoners
have, I may add, also made statements that they
had orders to kill all the English who fell into their
hands.</p>

<p>The evidence of this man of the 112th Regiment
was as explicit and assured as it could be. But the
matter did not stop there. At a later date an officer
of the same regiment fell into our hands, in whose
field note-book we found the memorandum “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Keine
Gefangene</span>” (“No prisoners”). He was immediately
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
cross-examined as to the meaning of this passage, but
he had a plausible explanation ready. It was to the
effect that his men were not to make the capture of
prisoners a pretext for retiring with them to the
rear; but, having disarmed them, were to leave them
to be taken back by the supports.</p>

<p>But at the end of April&mdash;too late, unfortunately,
for use by Lord Bryce’s Committee&mdash;one of our Intelligence
Officers placed before me the following
entry in the field note-book of a German prisoner,
Reinhart Brenneisen,<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> reservist, belonging to the 4th
Company, 112th Regiment, and dated in August (the
same month as appears on the face of the order in
question):</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="de" xml:lang="de">“Auch kam Brigadebefehl s&auml;mtliche Franzosen ob verwundet
oder nicht, die uns in die H&auml;nde fielen, sollten erschossen
werden. Es d&uuml;rfte keine Gefangenen gemacht werden.”</p>

<p>(“Then came a brigade order that all French, whether
wounded or not, who fell into our hands, were to be shot. No
prisoners were to be made.”)</p></blockquote>

<p>This, I think, may be said to put the reality of the
brigade order in question beyond doubt.</p>

<p>The cumulative effect of this evidence, coupled with
the statements of so many of our men who claim to
have been eye-witnesses of wholesale bayoneting of
the wounded, certainly confirms suspicions of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
gravest kind as to such acts having been done by
authority. Neither the temperament of the German
soldier nor the character of German discipline
(<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">furchtbar streng</em>&mdash;“frightfully strict”&mdash;as a German
prisoner put it to me) makes it probable that
the German soldiers acted on their own initiative.
It would, in any case, be incredible that so many cases
of outrage could be sufficiently explained by any law
of averages, or by the idiosyncrasies of the “bad
characters” present in every large congregation of
men.</p>

<h3 id="TREATMENT_OF_CIVIL_POPULATION">Treatment of Civil Population.</h3>

<p>The subject-matter of the inquiry may be classified
according as it relates to: (1) ill-treatment of the
civil population, and (2) breaches of the laws of war
in the field. As regards the first it is not too much
to say that the Germans pay little respect to life and
none to property. I say nothing of the monstrous
policy of vicarious responsibility laid down by them
in the Proclamations as to the treatment of hostages
which I forwarded to the Committee and which I left
to the Committee to examine; I confine myself to the
practices which have come under my observation.<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a>
Here it is clear that the treatment of civilians is regulated
by no more rational or humane policy than
that of intimidation or, even worse, of sullen vindictiveness.
As the German troops passed through the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
communes and towns of the arrondissements of
Ypres, Hazebrouck, Bethune, and Lille, they shot indiscriminately
at the innocent spectators of their
march; the peasant tilling his fields, the refugee
tramping the roads, and the workman returning to
his home. To be seen was often dangerous, to attempt
to escape being seen was invariably fatal. Old men
and boys and even women and young girls were shot
like rabbits. The slightest failure to comply with the
peremptory demands of the invader has been punished
with instant death. The cur&eacute; of Pradelle, having
failed to find the key of the church tower, was
put against the wall and shot; a shepherd at a lonely
farmhouse near Rebais who failed to produce bread
for the German troops had his head blown off by
a rifle; a baker at Moorslede who attempted to escape
was suffocated by German soldiers with his own scarf;
a young mother at Bailleul who was unable to produce
sufficient coffee to satisfy the demands of
twenty-three German soldiers had her baby seized
by one of the latter and its head dipped in scalding
water; an old man of seventy-seven years of age at
La Fert&eacute; Gaucher who attempted to protect two
women in his house from outrage was killed with a
rifle shot.</p>

<p>I select these instances from my notes at random&mdash;they
could be multiplied many times&mdash;as indications
of the temper of the German troops. They might,
perhaps, be dismissed as the unauthorised acts of
small patrols were it not that there is only too much
evidence to show that the soldiers are taught by their
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
superiors to set no value upon human life, and things
have been done which could not have been done without
superior orders. For example, at Bailleul,<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> La
Gorgue, and Doulieu, where no resistance of any kind
was offered to the German troops, and where the latter
were present in force under the command of commissioned
officers, civilians were taken in groups, and
after being forced to dig their own graves were shot
by firing parties in the presence of an officer. At
Doulieu,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> which is a small village, eleven civilians
were shot in this way; they were strangers to the
place, and it was only by subsequent examination of
the papers found on their bodies that some of them
were identified as inhabitants of neighbouring villages.
If these men had been guilty of any
act of hostility it is not clear why they were
not shot at once in their own villages, and
inquiries at some of the villages from which
they were taken have revealed no knowledge
of any act of the kind. It is, however, a common
practice for the German troops to seize the male inhabitants
(especially those of military age) of the
places they occupy and take them away on their
retreat. Twenty-five were so taken from Bailleul and
nothing has been heard of them since. There is only
too much reason to suppose that the same fate has
overtaken them as that which befell the unhappy men
executed at Doulieu. I believe the explanation of
these sinister proceedings to be that the men were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
compelled to dig trenches for the enemy, to give information
as to the movement of their own troops,
and to act as guides (all clearly practices which are a
breach of the laws of war and of the Hague Regulations),
and then, their presence being inconvenient
and their knowledge of the enemy’s positions and
movements compromising, they were put to death.
This is not a mere surmise. The male inhabitants of
Warneton were forced to dig trenches for the enemy,
and an inhabitant of Merris was compelled to go with
the German troops and act as a guide; it is notorious
that the official manual of the German General Staff,
<cite>Kriegsbrauch in Landskriege</cite>, condones, and indeed
indoctrinates, such breaches of the laws of war. British
soldiers who were taken prisoners by the Germans
and subsequently escaped were compelled by their
captors to dig trenches, and in a field note-book found
on a soldier of the 100th Saxon Body Grenadiers
(XIIth Corps) occurs the following significant passage:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“My two prisoners worked hard at digging trenches. At midday
I got the order to rejoin at village with my prisoners. I
was very glad, as I had been ordered to shoot them both as
the French attacked. Thank God it was not necessary.”</p></blockquote>

<p>In this connexion it is important to observe that
the German policy of holding a whole town or village
responsible for the acts of isolated individuals,
whether by the killing of hostages or by decimation
or by a wholesale <em>battue</em> of the inhabitants, has undoubtedly
resulted in the grossest and most irrelevant
cruelties. A single shot fired in or near a place occupied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
by the Germans&mdash;it may be a shot from a French
patrol or a German rifle let off by accident or mistake
or in a drunken affray&mdash;at once places the whole
community in peril, and it seems to be at once assumed
that the civil inhabitants are guilty unless they
can prove themselves innocent. This was clearly the
case at Armenti&egrave;res. Frequently, as the field note-book
of a Saxon officer testifies, they are not allowed
the opportunity. Indeed there seems some reason to
suppose that the German troops hold the civil inhabitants
responsible even for the acts of lawful belligerents,
and, as my inquiries at Merris and Messines go
to show, a French patrol cannot operate in the vicinity
of a French or Belgian village without exposing
the inhabitants to sanguinary punishment or predatory
fines. There is not the slightest evidence to show
that French civilians have fired upon German troops,
and in spite of the difficulty of proving a negative
there is a good deal of reason to reject such a supposition.
Throughout the communes of the region of
Northern France which I have investigated notices
were posted up at the mairie requiring all the inhabitants
to deposit any arms in their possession with
the civil authorities, and the orders appear to have
been complied with, as they were very strictly enforced.</p>

<p>In this matter of holding the civil population responsible
with their lives for anything that may
prove “inconvenient” (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">g&ecirc;nant</em>), to quote a German
Proclamation, to the German troops, the German commanders
seem to have no sense of cause and effect.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
At Coulommiers, so the Mayor informed me, they
threatened to shoot him because the gas supply gave
out. In a town which I visited close to the German
lines (and the name of which I suppress by request
of the civil authorities for fear of a vindictive bombardment),
the Mayor, who was under arrest in the
guardroom, was threatened with death because a signal-bell
rang at the railway station, and was in imminent
peril until it was proved that the act was due
to the clumsiness of a German soldier; and an exchange
of shots between two drunken soldiers, resulting
in the death of one of them, was made the ground
of an accusation that the inhabitants had fired on the
troops, the Mayor’s life being again in peril. Where
the life of the civilian is held so cheap, it is not surprising
that the German soldier, himself the subject of
a fearful discipline, is under a strong temptation to
escape punishment for the consequences of his own
careless or riotous or drunken behaviour by attributing
those consequences to the civil population, for the
latter is invariably suspected.</p>

<h3 id="OUTRAGES_UPON_WOMEN_THE_GERMAN_OCCUPATION_OF_BAILLEUL">Outrages upon Women&mdash;The German Occupation
of Bailleul.</h3>

<p>When life is held so cheap, it is not surprising that
honour and property are not held more dear. Outrages
upon the honour of women by German soldiers
have been so frequent that it is impossible to escape
the conviction that they have been condoned and indeed
encouraged by German officers. As regards this
matter I have made a most minute study of the German
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
occupation of Bailleul. This place was occupied
by a regiment of German Hussars in October for a
period of eight days. During the whole of that period
the town was delivered over to the excesses of a
licentious soldiery and was left in a state of indescribable
filth. There were at least thirty cases of outrages
on girls and young married women, authenticated
by sworn statements of witnesses and generally
by medical certificates of injury. It is extremely
probable that, owing to the natural reluctance of
women to give evidence in cases of this kind, the
actual number of outrages largely exceeds this. Indeed,
the leading physician of the town, Dr. Bels,
puts the number as high as sixty. At least five officers
were guilty of such offences, and where the officers
set the example the men followed. The circumstances
were often of a peculiarly revolting character;
daughters were outraged in the presence of their
mothers, and mothers in the presence or the hearing
of their little children. In one case, the facts of
which are proved by evidence which would satisfy
any court of law, a young girl of nineteen was violated
by one officer while the other held her mother
by the throat and pointed a revolver, after which the
two officers exchanged their respective r&ocirc;les.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> The
officers and soldiers usually hunted in couples, either
entering the houses under pretence of seeking billets,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
or forcing the doors by open violence. Frequently
the victims were beaten and kicked, and invariably
threatened with a loaded revolver if they resisted.
The husband or father of the women and girls was
usually absent on military service; if one was present
he was first ordered away under some pretext; and
disobedience of civilians to German orders, however
improper, is always punished with instant death. In
several cases little children heard the cries and struggles
of their mother in the adjoining room to which
she had been carried by a brutal exercise of force.
No attempt was made to keep discipline, and the officers,
when appealed to for protection, simply
shrugged their shoulders. Horses were stabled in
saloons; shops and private houses were looted (there
are nine hundred authenticated cases of pillage).
Some civilians were shot and many others carried off
into captivity. Of the fate of the latter nothing is
known, but the worst may be suspected.</p>

<p>The German troops were often drunk and always
insolent. But significantly enough, the bonds of
discipline thus relaxed were tightened at will and
hardly a single straggler was left behind.</p>

<p>Inquiries in other places, in the villages of Meteren,
Oultersteen, and Nieppe, for example, establish the occurrence
of similar outrages upon defenceless women,
accompanied by every circumstance of disgusting barbarity.
No civilian dare attempt to protect his wife
or daughter from outrage. To be in possession of
weapons of defence is to be condemned to instant
execution, and even a village constable found in possession
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
of a revolver (which he was required to carry
in virtue of his office) was instantly shot at Westoutre.
Roving patrols burnt farm-houses and turned the
women and children out into the wintry and sodden
fields with capricious cruelty and in pursuance of
no intelligible military purpose.</p>

<h3 id="PRIVATE_PROPERTY">Private Property.</h3>

<p>As regards private property, respect for it among
the German troops simply does not exist. By the universal
testimony of every British officer and soldier
whom I have interrogated the progress of German
troops is like a plague of locusts over the land. What
they cannot carry off they destroy. Furniture is
thrown into the street, pictures are riddled with bullets
or pierced by sword cuts, municipal registers
burnt, the contents of shops scattered over the floor,
drawers rifled, live stock slaughtered and the carcases
left to rot in the fields. This was the spectacle which
frequently confronted our troops on the advance to
the Aisne and on their clearance of the German
troops out of Northern France. Cases of petty
larceny by German soldiers appear to be innumerable;
they take whatever seizes their fancy, and leave
the towns they evacuate laden like pedlars. Empty
ammunition waggons were drawn up in front of
private houses and filled with their contents for
despatch to Germany.</p>

<p>I have had the reports of the local commissaires
of police placed before me, and they show that in
smaller villages like those of Caestre and Merris, with
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
a population of about 1,500 souls or less, pillaging to
the extent of &pound;4,000 and &pound;6,000 was committed by the
German troops. I speak here of robbery which does
not affect to be anything else. But it is no uncommon
thing to find extortion officially practised by the commanding
officers under various more or less flimsy
pretexts. One of these consists of holding a town
or village up to ransom under pretence that shots
have been fired at the German troops. Thus at the
village of Merris a sum of &pound;2,000 was exacted as a
fine from the Mayor at the point of a revolver under
this pretence, this village of 1,159 inhabitants having
already been pillaged to the extent of some
&pound;6,000 worth of goods. At La Gorgue, another small
village, &pound;2,000 was extorted under a threat that if it
were not forthcoming the village would be burnt. At
Warneton, a small village, a fine of &pound;400 was levied.
These fines were, it must be remembered, quite independent
of the requisitions of supplies. As regards
the latter, one of our Intelligence officers, whose duty
it has been to examine the forms of receipt given by
German officers and men for such requisitions, informs
me that, while the receipts for small sums of
100 francs or less bore a genuine signature, those for
large sums were invariably signed “<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Herr Hauptmann
von Koepenick,</span>” the simple peasants upon whom this
fraud was practised being quite unaware that the
signature has a classical fictitiousness in Germany.</p>

<h3 id="OBSERVATIONS_ON_A_TOUR_OF_THE_MARNE_AND_THE_AISNE">Observations on a Tour of the Marne and the Aisne.</h3>

<p>My investigations, in the company of a French
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
Staff Officer, in the towns and villages of our line
of march in that part of France which lies north-east
of Paris revealed a similar spirit of pillage and
wantonness. Coulommiers, a small town, was so
thoroughly pillaged that the damage, so I was informed
by the Maire, has been assessed at 400,000
francs, a statement which bore out the evidence
previously given me by our own men as to the
spectacle of wholesale looting which they encountered
when they entered that town. At Barcy, an insignificant
village of no military importance, I was
informed by the Maire that a German officer, accompanied
by a soldier, entered the communal archives
and deliberately burnt the municipal registers of
births and deaths&mdash;obviously an exercise of pure
spite. At Choisy-au-Bac, a little village pleasantly
situated on the banks of the Aisne, which I visited
in company with a French Staff Officer, I found that
almost every house had been burnt out. This was
one of the worst examples of deliberate incendiarism
that I have come across. There had been no engagement,
and there was not a trace of shell-fire or of
bullet-marks upon the walls. Inquiries among the
local gendarmerie, and such few of the homeless inhabitants
as were left, pointed to the place having
been set on fire by German soldiers in a spirit of pure
wantonness. The German troops arrived one day in
the late afternoon, and an officer, after inquiring of
an inhabitant, who told me the story, the name of
the village, noted it down, with the remark “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Bien,
nous le r&ocirc;tirons ce soir.</span>” At nine o’clock of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
same evening they proceeded to “roast” it by breaking
the windows of the houses and throwing into the
interiors burning “pastilles,” apparently carried for
the purpose, which immediately set everything alight.
The local gendarme informed us that they also
sprayed (<em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">arros&eacute;</em>) some of the houses with petrol to
make them burn better. The humbler houses shared
the fate of the more opulent, and cottage and mansion
were involved in a common ruin. It seems quite
clear that there was not the slightest pretext for
this wanton behaviour, nor did the Germans allege
one. They did not accuse the inhabitants of any
hostile behaviour; the best proof of this is that they
did not shoot any of them, except one who appears
to have been shot by accident.</p>

<p>A visit to Senlis in the course of the same tour
fully confirmed all that the French Commission has
already reported as to the cruel devastation wrought
by the Germans in that unhappy town. The main
street was one silent quarry of ruined houses burnt
by the hands of the German soldiers, and hardly a
soul was to be seen. Even cottages and concierges’
lodges had been set on fire. I have seen few sights
more pitiful and none more desolate. Towns further
east, such as Sermaizes, Nomeny, Gerbevillers, were
razed to the ground with fire and sword and are as
the Cities of the Plain.</p>

<h3 id="BESTIALITY_OF_GERMAN_OFFICERS_AND_MEN">Bestiality of German Officers and Men.</h3>

<p>Before I leave the subject of the treatment of private
property by the German troops, I should like
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
to draw the attention of the reader to some unpleasant
facts which throw a baneful light on the temper of
German officers and men. If one thing is more clearly
established than another by my inquiries among the
officers of our Staff and divisional commands, it is
that ch&acirc;teaux or private houses used as the head-quarters
of German officers were frequently found to
have been left in a state of bestial pollution, which
can only be explained by gross drunkenness or filthy
malice. Whichever be the explanation, the fact remains
that, while to use the beds and the upholstery
of private houses as a latrine is not an atrocity, it
indicates a state of mind sufficiently depraved to commit
one. Many of these incidents, related to me by
our own officers from their own observations, are so
disgusting that they are unfit for publication. They
point to deliberate defilement.</p>

<p>The public has been shocked by the evidence, accepted
by the Committee as genuine, which tells of
such mutilations of women and children as only the
Kurds of Asia Minor had been thought capable of
perpetrating. But the Committee were fully justified
in accepting it&mdash;they could not do otherwise&mdash;and
they have by no means published the whole.
Pathologists can best supply the explanation of these
crimes. I have been told by such that it is not at
all uncommon in cases of rape or sexual excess to find
that the criminal, when satiated by lust, attempts to
murder or mutilate his victim. This is presumably
the explanation&mdash;if one can talk of explanation&mdash;of
outrages which would otherwise be incredible. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Committee hint darkly at perverted sexual instinct.
Cases of sodomy and of the rape of little children did
undoubtedly occur on a very large scale. Some of
the worst things have never been published. This
is not the time for mincing one’s words, but for plain
speech. Disgusting though it is, I therefore do not
hesitate to place on record an incident at Rebais related
to me by the Mayor of Coulommiers in the presence
of several of his fellow-townsmen with corroborative
detail. A respectable woman in that town was
seized by some Uhlans who intended to ravish her,
but her condition made rape impossible. What followed
is better described in French:</p>

<blockquote>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Mme. H&mdash;&mdash;, cafeti&egrave;re &agrave; Rebais, mise nue par une patrouille
allemande, oblig&eacute;e de parcourir ainsi toute sa maison, chass&eacute;e
dans la rue et oblig&eacute;e de regarder les cadavres de soldats
anglais. Les allemands lui barbouillent la figure avec le sang
de ses regles.”</p></blockquote>

<p>It is almost needless to say that the woman went
mad. There is very strong reason to suspect that
young girls were carried off to the trenches by licentious
German soldiery, and there abused by hordes of
savages and licentious men. People in hiding in the
cellars of houses have heard the voices of women in
the hands of German soldiers crying all night long
until death or stupor ended their agonies. One of our
officers, a subaltern in the sappers, heard a woman’s
shrieks in the night coming from behind the German
trenches near Richebourg l’Avou&eacute;; when we advanced
in the morning and drove the Germans out, a girl was
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
found lying naked on the ground “pegged out” in
the form of a crucifix. I need not go on with this
chapter of horrors. To the end of time it will be
remembered, and from one generation to another, in
the plains of Flanders, in the valleys of the Vosges,
and on the rolling fields of the Marne, the oral tradition
of men will perpetuate this story of infamy and
wrong.</p>

<h3 id="CONCLUSION">Conclusion.</h3>

<p>I should say that in the above summary I have confined
myself to the result of the inquiries I made at
General Head-quarters and in the area of our occupation,
and have not attempted to summarise the evidence
I had previously taken from the British officers
and soldiers at the base, as the latter may be left to
speak for itself in the depositions already published
by the Committee. The object of the summary is to
show how far independent inquiries on the spot go
to confirm it. The testimony of our soldiers as to the
reign of terror which they found prevailing on their
arrival in all the places from which they drove the
enemy out was amply confirmed by these subsequent
and local investigations.</p>

<p>It will, of course, be understood that these inquiries
of mine were limited in scope and can by no means
claim to be exhaustive. For one thing, I was the only
representative of the Home Office sent to France for
this purpose; for another, I did not become attached
to General Head-quarters until the beginning of February,
and before that time little or nothing had been
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span>
done in the way of systematic inquiry by the Staff,
whose officers had other and more pressing duties to
perform. By that time the testimony to many grave
incidents, especially in the field, had perished with
those who witnessed them and they remained but a
sombre memory. The hearsay evidence of these
things which was sometimes all that was left made
an impression on my mind as deep as it was painful,
but it would have been contrary to the rules of evidence,
to which I have striven to conform, for me to
take notice of it.</p>

<p>Two things clearly emerge from this observation.
One is that had there been from the beginning of the
campaign a regular system of inquiry at General
Head-quarters into these things, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">pari passu</em> with their
occurrence, the volume of evidence, great though it
is, would have been infinitely greater; the other, that,
as there is only too much reason to suppose that with
the growing vindictiveness of the enemy things will
be worse before they are better, the case for the establishment
of such a system throughout the continuance
of the War is one that calls for serious consideration.</p>

<p>Although I have some claims to write as a jurist
I have here made no attempt to pray in aid the Hague
Regulations in order to frame the counts of an indictment.
The Germans have broken all laws, human
and divine, and not even the ancient freemasonry of
arms, whose honourable traditions are almost as old
as war itself, has restrained them in their brutal and
licentious fury. It is useless to attempt to discriminate
between the people and their rulers; an abundance
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
of diaries of soldiers in the ranks shows that
all are infected with a common spirit. That spirit
is pride, not the pride of high and pure endeavour,
but that pride for which the Greeks found a name
in the word ὕβρις, the insolence which knows no
pity and feels no love. Long ago Renan warned
Strauss of this canker which was eating into the German
character. Pedants indoctrinated it, Generals
instilled it, the Emperor preached it. The whole people
were taught that war was a normal state of
civilisation, that the lust of conquest and the arrogance
of race were the most precious of the virtues.
On this Dead Sea fruit the German people have
been fed for a generation until they are rotten to
the core.

<p class="hang">DEPOSITIONS AND STATEMENTS (FIFTY-SIX IN NUMBER)
ILLUSTRATING BREACHES OF THE LAWS OF WAR BY
THE GERMAN TROOPS, MAINLY OUTRAGES ON BRITISH
SOLDIERS</p>

<blockquote>

<p><em>Note.</em>&mdash;These documents are here made public for the first
time. They have not been published either in the Bryce Report
or in the <cite>Nineteenth Century and After</cite>. I have selected the
cases of Bailleul and Doulieu as typical of all the rest. Many
other communes, <em>e.g.</em>, Meteren, Steenwerck, La Gorgue, Vieux-Berquin,
suffered a similar fate. As regards Bailleul itself I
have given only one out of some twenty documents in my possession
relating to the rapes committed there; the others are
in no way inferior in authenticity, nor are they any less horrible.
My object is not to multiply proofs, but to exemplify
them. It will be observed that the evidence of British soldiers
here given is that of eye-witnesses, except, of course, in cases
of rape. As regards the latter, the hearsay evidence is fully
corroborated by the French depositions of the victims.&mdash;J. H. M.</p></blockquote>

<h4>(1)</h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Private</span> R. R&mdash;&mdash;, 1st Royal Scots:&mdash;At Ypres, on
November 11th (the day I was wounded), the Germans
had made an attack on the trenches in front of
us&mdash;we were back in the dug-outs. We went up to
support and drove them back. In the trench were
about a dozen Germans, our men having retired towards
us. The Germans were kneeling with one hand
up to let us see that they had surrendered; so we
thought it was all right, and we turned our attention
to firing at those who were retiring. One of the
officers of our regiment, but not of my company, was
at the side of the trench and had picked up a rifle
to fire at the retreating Germans. I saw one of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
Germans who had surrendered&mdash;I think he was an
officer&mdash;raise his revolver (we had had no time to disarm
them) and shoot at our officer, who dropped. Another
man and I then shot the German.</p>

<h4>(2)</h4>

<p>Private W. M&mdash;&mdash;, 1st Wilts, &mdash; Company:&mdash;(1)
On the Aisne, between September 14th and 22nd, I
was in B Company and going to A Company for a
wounded man. I am a bandsman and have acted as
stretcher-bearer. The Germans came out of a wood
with a white flag. The captain (Captain R&mdash;&mdash;) of
&mdash; Company gave the order to cease fire&mdash;the Company
was in the trenches. Captain R&mdash;&mdash; went forward
alone towards the Germans, and the German
officer then shot Captain R&mdash;&mdash; with his revolver
and the rest of the Germans opened a heavy fire.
Number &mdash; Company replied and drove the Germans
back.</p>

<p>(2) At La Bass&eacute;e, between October 12th and 27th,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
the Germans had shelled our trenches and driven us
out, their infantry advancing in close formation. By
that time only eleven out of B Company, including
myself, were left. The Germans were within fifty
yards of us and so we retired through a brewery
down to a farm-house. We went upstairs&mdash;a mixed
lot from various regiments (West Kents, Royal Irish
Rifles, etc.), and began firing from the windows.
From the upstairs we saw the Germans bayoneting
those of our wounded who had been left in the
trenches or placed under cover by us eleven, behind
them, or had crawled along.</p>

<p>(3) At La Cout&eacute;rie,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> about 3 kilometres from La
Bass&eacute;e, it must have been before October 12th, because
that was the day we got to La Bass&eacute;e, we took
possession of a farm-house for a dressing station.
The farmer’s wife frequently took food and clothes
down to the cellar, she said it was for her daughter;
the daughter would not come up. The mother, who
was crying as she told us, made out to us that the
“Allemands” had outraged her daughter&mdash;she held
up five fingers.</p>

<h4>(3)</h4>

<p>Private J. S&mdash;&mdash;, Rifle Brigade, 1st Battalion:&mdash;On
a Sunday at end of October or beginning of November,
just outside Bailleul, near Nieppe, we rested
for three hours, having just come out of billets. The
Germans had only just left&mdash;the chalk-marks of the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
different regiments were still on the doors. There
were a lot of refugees outside an <em>estaminet</em>, among
them a mother and two daughters. One daughter
looked scared to death, her eyes staring out of her
head. She was a girl of about twenty-three, who
looked rather delicate. The girl said nothing, stood
there and stared like a lunatic. The mother told a
group of us in broken English and partly in French&mdash;I
know some French. She said, “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Allemands
couchent avec ma fille</span>”&mdash;that the Germans&mdash;she made
it appear about eight&mdash;had outraged her daughter.
We did not go into the <em>estaminet</em>&mdash;it was forbidden.</p>

<h4>(4)</h4>

<p>Captain C&mdash;&mdash; W&mdash;&mdash;, Bedfords, 2nd Battalion:&mdash;At
Bailleul, I saw a great deal of evidence of wanton
destruction&mdash;mirrors broken and furniture
smashed. A German cavalry regiment had done it.
I was in three different billets there, and in all three
the same thing had happened.</p>

<h4>(5)</h4>

<p>Private S&mdash;&mdash;, K. O. Scottish Borderers:&mdash;At
Ypres, about a month ago, I was in the trenches and
one of our men went out of the trenches to get a
drink of water (from a spring about seven yards
away). He was wounded in the leg, and an officer
(Lieutenant S&mdash;&mdash;, of B Company) sent over for
the stretcher-bearers, who were at head-quarters
about 300 yards from the support trenches. They
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
were carrying this fellow away when one of the
stretcher-bearers was “sniped” from about 300
yards. There was no firing at the time. Another
man came of B Company, named G&mdash;&mdash;, volunteered
and took the wounded stretcher-bearer’s place, and
then he was wounded too. G&mdash;&mdash; was put on a
stretcher and was again wounded by a sniper. Cases
of this kind were very common.</p>

<h4>(6)</h4>

<p>Private J. C&mdash;&mdash;, Scottish Fusiliers, 1st Battalion:&mdash;At
Locre, near Bailleul, I was billeted in the
church there at the beginning of December. The
church had not been shelled, but had been looted
and the crucifixes had been smashed, and all the
images and things of value appeared to have been
torn away.</p>

<h4>(7)</h4>

<p>Corporal J. D. B&mdash;&mdash; (at that time Bombardier in
the 49th Battery R.F.A.) now of the 40th Brigade
Ammunition Column R.F.A.:&mdash;On August 23rd at
Mons, we got the order to advance up a hill with
our battery. We got a section of guns in action
in a ploughed field, and then we had a sergeant
hit with a gunshot wound in the back (it was Sergeant
T&mdash;&mdash;, of the 49th Battery R.F.A.). Sergeant
R&mdash;&mdash;, of the 49th, asked me to take Sergeant
T&mdash;&mdash; to an ambulance. I took him through a wood,
and on the outside of the wood I saw a girl quite
naked, running for all she was worth. She appeared
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
to me to be about nineteen years of age.
Her body was covered with blood and there was
blood all over her breasts. She ran into some
trenches on my right. I do not know what regiment
occupied them, but I heard afterwards that
an officer of the Gordons got hold of her. I went
straight on with the sergeant down into Mons, and
took him to the field hospital.</p>

<h4>(8)</h4>

<p>Private S&mdash;&mdash;, C Company, 1st King’s R.R.:&mdash;It
was on September 11th, I can never forget that
date, it was after we left the Marne, and a day or
two before the Aisne, we were engaged with the
enemy at a distance of about 1,200 yards. They
put up a white flag in their centre and waved it
from side to side. We stopped firing, whereupon
they fired heavily from their right flank. A second
time they put up the white flag, this time on the
right flank; but we took no notice of this and kept
on firing.</p>

<h4>(9)</h4>

<p>R. McK&mdash;&mdash;, 2nd Royal Irish, &mdash; Co.:&mdash;About the
end of November, near Neuve Chapelle, there was a
heavy attack, and we retired to get reinforcements,
and left Sergeant G&mdash;&mdash; wounded in the leg in the
trenches; when I last saw him he was binding up
his wound. About 300 yards back we got reinforcements,
and as we were advancing we saw three Germans
bayoneting Sergeant G&mdash;&mdash;.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span></p>

<h4>(10)</h4>

<p>R. McK&mdash;&mdash;, 2nd Royal Irish, at Mt. Kemmel:&mdash;On
Monday I was sent to get water from a pump
in the yard of a house about 50 yards behind the
line, a farm-house, and in the kitchen I saw seven
men and three women, a poor class of people, lying
on the ground bayoneted. The house had been
looted and everything smashed.</p>

<h4>(11)</h4>

<p>W. F&mdash;&mdash;, Sapper, 17th R.E.:&mdash;About September
7th, near Lagny, we arrived at the village; stopped
there for four hours while our artillery were in action.
We had a house pointed out to us by the villagers;
there was a broken motor bicycle outside,
and in the room against the wall we found one of
our despatch riders with an officer’s sword sticking
through him. Our sergeant and our section officer
told us that the villagers said that he came one night,
having lost his way, and knocked at the door of
the house, which was occupied by German officers;
they let him in and then killed him. The house was
in a terrible state, everything pulled to pieces. Sapper
W&mdash;&mdash; of our company was the first to find the
house.</p>

<h4>(12)</h4>

<p>Private M&mdash;&mdash;, 1st Gordons, &mdash; Co.:&mdash;On October
24th, at La Bass&eacute;e, the Germans broke through our
lines, and as we retreated I was hit in the hip with
a shell. The Germans crossed over our trenches and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
charged till they met our reserves and were driven
back. I saw Private E&mdash;&mdash; (of Portsmouth) of my
Company lying wounded in the hip. As they passed,
some stepped on top of me, some jumped over me,
while others as they passed E&mdash;&mdash; kicked him and
stamped on his face. When he was brought into
the dressing-station his face was absolutely black. I
never heard anything more of him.</p>

<h4>(13)</h4>

<p>J. G&mdash;&mdash;, Lance-Corporal, King’s Own, 1st Batt.:&mdash;At
the end of November, the second day after we
arrived at Nieppe, two of us entered an estaminet
and found the landlady crying; she told us that about
thirteen Germans violated her daughter and shot her
husband against a wall in front of her eyes. She
said there were a lot of other cases in Nieppe.</p>

<h4>(14)</h4>

<p>J. A&mdash;&mdash;, Private, 1st Camerons:&mdash;It was about
October 23rd, at St. Jean (Ypres). We retired, owing
to shortage of ammunition, and left two wounded
in the trench. When we came back one of them
was lying about 20 yards behind the trenches stripped
stark naked. We had left him behind covered with
a waterproof cloak.</p>

<p>When darkness set in, on retiring, I waited behind
to carry in one of the wounded. I lost the
road and walked into the German lines with my comrade
on my back. I was seized and my hands tied
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
in front; I was then kicked by several German soldiers
and thrown into a cellar. They kept pointing
a bayonet at my heart. They took away all my food,
tobacco, private letters, everything, and ate my food
in front of me. After about twenty hours the East
Surreys came up and released us.</p>

<h4>(15)</h4>

<p>J. W. D&mdash;&mdash;, Private, 1st Batt. Cheshires:&mdash;On
November 14th, at Ypres, the Germans broke in our
trenches and as we tried to get out most of us were
shot. As they retreated, after being driven back
from the communication trenches, at about 4.45 on
the Saturday (November 14th), I was lying
wounded in the leg at the bottom of the trench
unable to rise and a German officer stooped down
and shot me in the thigh. I saw the same thing
done by other Germans to other men of my company.</p>

<h4>(16)</h4>

<p>C. R. A&mdash;&mdash;, Private, 10th King’s Liverpool Scottish:&mdash;At
Kemmel (I think), a place between Ypres
and Armenti&egrave;res, not far from Locre&mdash;Kemmel is
just close to the trenches, and about the size of Appleby&mdash;I,
with two or three others, was out looking
for vegetables for the officers (I was sent for because
I speak French), and we were looking to see
if any one remained in the house. While doing this
I came across the R.F.A., who took us to their head-quarters
and supplied us with vegetables, etc.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Further up the valley we came upon a man in
civilian clothes who was standing in a doorway. The
house had not been damaged by shell fire, as practically
all the rest were. We began to talk. He
told me in French that he was too old for the army,
but had a son-in-law in the Belgian Army. When
the Germans came they ransacked all the houses. Of
those who came to his house some held him off with
arms pointed at him, whilst others outraged his
daughter-in-law who was about to give birth to a
child. When I was there this poor woman had been
sent away.</p>

<h4>(17)</h4>

<p>Private C&mdash;&mdash;, York L. I., 2nd Batt.:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) About November 17th or 20th, near Ypres, I
was with the machine gun which was put out of action;
I then went into my own company’s trenches.
As it was getting dark, the advance was made and
we were up to the wire entanglements; we were
driven back by superior numbers. Having gained
our own trench, the roll was called and about seventeen
were missing out of our Co., Corpl. R&mdash;&mdash; being
amongst them. Under cover of darkness our
reinforcements came up and we advanced again. We
could only find seven wounded of the men missing
and no German wounded at all. At the back of
their trenches was a wood where we lost the Germans.
So we dropped back to their trench. About
three days afterwards they attacked in large numbers,
but were repulsed and were driven back further
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
than they had advanced. In our advance we came
to a farm and a barn half full of potatoes where
we found three of our wounded and two dead. Some
of our men carried them out, and while we carried
them one of the others died. Corporal R&mdash;&mdash; (who
was among the five) was the worst wounded&mdash;he had
been shot through the shoulder, and was insensible
with both his eyes gouged out and his right arm
hacked off. Our O.C. told us on a parade that it was
done with a bayonet. He was sent home I heard to
a hospital.</p>

<p>(2) At a village about 3 miles S.E. of Ypres, about
three weeks next Monday, forty-five of us advanced
to rush a house; only seven of us returned. As we
were advancing they opened fire on us with a machine
gun. We were only about fifteen strong when
we got there. We had to break an entrance through
the window. We heard shouts and a disturbance
inside; it was the Germans making for the cellars.
Captain A&mdash;&mdash; went upstairs after leaving some men
on the cellar steps; I followed him. In the back
room upstairs was a maxim gun. In one of the other
rooms was a girl about fifteen&mdash;she had nothing on
except a man’s overcoat. When we broke into the
room we thought she was absolutely mad. She cried
out something, but we could not understand what
it was. She rushed out of the room into the front
bedroom which was locked. We smashed it in with
our rifle butts and there found a woman, her mother,
with her right breast all bleeding, and her clothes
torn&mdash;her breast had been cut as if with a sword,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
not a bayonet. We used our field bandages and
made her as comfortable as we could and sent a volunteer
back for stretcher-bearers.</p>

<p>[This soldier was at times in great pain when he
spoke, but his mind was clear. I am convinced he
spoke the truth.&mdash;J. H. M.]</p>

<h4>(18)</h4>

<p>Corporal D&mdash;&mdash;, Loyal North Lancs., 1st Batt.:&mdash;At
Ypres, end of November, I was in the trenches,
and I saw two of our men, who had been sent out
as snipers, hit, and the Germans motioned to them
to come into their trenches (which were about 80
yards from ours); they began to crawl in, and as
they got on the parapet of the trench the Germans
shot them.</p>

<h4>(19)</h4>

<p>J. A&mdash;&mdash;, Private, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders,
2nd Batt.:&mdash;About the beginning of December
we were billeted in the outskirts of Armenti&egrave;res,
and were allowed out between twelve and three. We
passed a man standing at his door, and he asked us
if we had any bully beef&mdash;we said no, but we offered
him a packet of cigarettes. We stood at the door
talking and his wife and children came to the door.
The woman looked bad&mdash;very delicate looking. He
then told us that nine Germans had stopped in the
house, and some of them had outraged his wife while
he was in the house. He spoke very fair English.
Private McM&mdash;&mdash; and S&mdash;&mdash; were with me.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span></p>

<h4>(20)</h4>

<p>Private K&mdash;&mdash;, 1st Loyal North Lancs.:&mdash;On Monday
night we attacked them and took two trenches.
Everything was quiet till the next morning except
for sniping. At about 8.30 they advanced upon us,
and the officer of &mdash;&mdash; Company, seeing the men were
overpowered, put up the white flag, and the men put
their hands up to surrender. The Germans advanced,
and when they got up to the trenches, they shot them
each in their trenches as they stood. <em>I saw this. I
was on the left flank.</em></p>

<h4>(21)</h4>

<p>Sergeant C&mdash;&mdash;, 1st Glosters:&mdash;Last Wednesday
morning, near La Bass&eacute;e, I was in the trench, and
I saw a wounded man of No. A Co. (who had had
to retire from their trenches on our right, having
been enfiladed during the night) crawling on all fours
to get back. When the Germans saw him they turned
a machine gun on him and killed him.</p>

<p>About end of November, near Ypres, a Belgian
farmer (a kind of peasant), who spoke a little English
(I can speak some French; I have a French conversation
book with me), told me that a German
officer threatened him with a revolver because he
tried to protect his daughter, and the officer forced
the girl to sleep with him for four nights.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span></p>

<h4>(22)</h4>

<p>Sergeant G&mdash;&mdash;, 2nd Devons:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) At Estaires, about five weeks ago (latter part
of November), we were billeted there, and I and
another sergeant went into a caf&eacute;. The proprietor,
who spoke quite good English, said that his daughter
had been outraged by a party of Germans while
they were occupying. They forced the daughter out
into a linhey (an outhouse) at the back and there
outraged her.</p>

<p>(2) At Laventie, about a week later, we halted;
and I was speaking to a Frenchwoman who spoke
English. She told me that the Germans had looted
everything, and showed me a jeweller’s shop which
had been stripped of nearly everything. She pointed
out two girls (I think about seventeen or eighteen)
who, she said, had been outraged.</p>

<h4>(23)</h4>

<p>Private C&mdash;&mdash;, A.S.C., 7th Div., Supply Column:&mdash;At
Westoutre, near Poperinghe, we were billeted
about two months ago at a priest’s house. He spoke
English, and told me that his father was shot by
the Germans against the church-yard railings because
he refused to give up the stores of which he
had charge for the Belgian refugees. He told us
that the Germans had practised a lot of outrages on
the women.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span></p>

<h4>(24)</h4>

<p>Lance-Corporal L&mdash;&mdash;, R.E., 55th Co.:&mdash;Near
Ypres, about October 22nd or 23rd, our section was
ordered to assist the Highland Light Infantry,
Queen’s and Worcesters in a drive through a wood.
We passed a cottage on our right where fighting was
going on. As we returned I saw two of our soldiers
in a doorway carrying a wounded man. When they
got out of the doorway one of the two soldiers was
shot in the back by a German at a distance of about
80 yards. All firing had ceased&mdash;it was a deliberate
aim. On the same day I saw two stretcher-bearers,
who were tending a man on the ground, fired at at
a distance of about 40 yards&mdash;a regular fusillade.
There was no fighting going on&mdash;our other troops
were about 300 or 400 yards ahead, and these snipers
had been left behind by the Germans for the express
purpose of picking off our wounded.</p>

<h4>(25)</h4>

<p>Private S&mdash;&mdash;, 1st Northampton:&mdash;On the day
after General F&mdash;&mdash; was killed (he was an artillery
general), on the Monday, we advanced 14 miles,
about, and bivouacked in a field. From our bivouac,
about one mile distant, there was a little farm. We
went to the farm to fill our water bottles, and a
woman told us that her two daughters (whom we
also saw) had been outraged the previous night by
twelve or fourteen Germans. The woman spoke English
quite well&mdash;at least, well enough for me to understand&mdash;very
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
distinctly. The woman was not excited,
but greatly distressed, and the two girls (one
child sixteen, the other about nineteen&mdash;in fact, I
think the woman said that the one was not sixteen)
were still more distressed; they were in a pitiful
plight. Listening to the story with me were Company
Sergeant-Major M&mdash;&mdash; of D. Co., also Sergeant
S&mdash;&mdash;, also D. Co., and Corporal C&mdash;&mdash;, likewise of
D. Co.</p>

<h4>(26)</h4>

<p>Captain F&mdash;&mdash;, 2nd Batt. Coldstreams:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) On the Rentel ridge, near Ypres, and south of
Sonnen, I have seen repeated cases of deliberate firing
on stretcher-bearers which admitted of no doubt.</p>

<p>(2) On the Aisne, on a Monday (either September
13th or 14th) at Soupir, there was a bad case of
trickery with the white flag. The Germans advanced
from a farm-house with white flags at the end of their
rifles, and on our men rushing forward, despite the
warning of their officers, to take prisoners, they were
shot down. We lost a whole company of the 3rd
Batt. Coldstreams in this way.</p>

<h4>(27)</h4>

<p>Private L&mdash;&mdash;, in the 1st Cornwall L.I.:&mdash;On September
9th (Wednesday) at Montreuil, I was
wounded and being carried by two of ours, when
about a quarter-mile from the firing-line I and other
wounded were being brought down an exposed slope;
the moment we appeared a machine-gun about 400
yards distant opened fire on us&mdash;several wounded hit.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span></p>

<h4>(28)</h4>

<p>Private W&mdash;&mdash;, in the 1st Camerons:&mdash;On the
Aisne, September 14th, I was told by Sergeant Major
C&mdash;&mdash; of Camerons that Captain H&mdash;&mdash; (commanding
our Company) was lying in a field having his
wounds dressed by one of our own bandsmen acting
as stretcher-bearer. Captain H&mdash;&mdash; and stretcher-bearer
were shot by a German officer. The Sergeant-Major
(who had been taken prisoner by the Germans)
saw this happen.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>[<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This story was fully corroborated,
without variation, by several other Camerons
whom I met in other wards, and also by the
Colonel of the Camerons, with whom I discussed
the matter at General Hospital No. 4 (Paris) at
Versailles.&mdash;J. H. M.]</p></blockquote>

<h4>(29)</h4>

<p>Private W&mdash;&mdash; (the same):&mdash;We were advancing,
Black Watch on our right, Scots Guards on our left.
Germans put up white flag and we advanced to take
prisoners. At thirty yards they opened their ranks,
and machine-guns concealed behind fired upon us,
the Germans in front also firing their rifles.</p>

<h4>(30)</h4>

<p>Private S&mdash;&mdash;, 1st Batt. Glosters:&mdash;On August
26th, first day of retreat from Fevrel, we were leaving
the trenches, B. Co. covering us on the left. It
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
was just where Captain S&mdash;&mdash; was shot. Private
L&mdash;&mdash;, who had been shot twice, was bayoneted when
lying on the ground by two Germans. I and the
whole Company saw it.</p>

<h4>(31)</h4>

<p>Private B&mdash;&mdash;, West Yorks:&mdash;On September 20th,
300 Germans ran up with a German officer and white
flag, surrendering. About a thousand Germans followed
and captured our Company of about 220. They
bayoneted Sergeant-Major A&mdash;&mdash; after surrender of
the Company, and shot majority of the Company.
I was only three yards from Sergeant-Major when
it happened. I fell over a hedge into a stone quarry
and escaped. Here it was that Major I&mdash;&mdash; was
killed. Later the Durhams came up and we got off.</p>

<h4>(32)</h4>

<p>Private (Lance-Corporal) C&mdash;&mdash;, 1st East Lancs:&mdash;About
September 6th, Ch&acirc;teau de Perense, near
Jouasse, Seine et Marne, about 700 Germans, coming
out of a wood, dropped their rifles and held up
their hands; whistle sounded “cease fire.” Two Companies
sent up to accept surrender, and when within
about ten yards the Germans ran back to the wood
and their troops in wood opened fire on the two companies
(<em>i.e.</em> on about 450 men).</p>

<h4>(33)</h4>

<p>Private C&mdash;&mdash; (the same):&mdash;Passed through a village
recently occupied by drunken Germans. Women
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
raving. Saw two women with bruised faces and black
eyes. Lieut. M&mdash;&mdash; said they had attempted to resist
outrage by Germans.</p>

<h4>(34)</h4>

<p>Private M&mdash;&mdash;, Notts and Derby:&mdash;On September
20th (Sunday) in trenches on Aisne, seventy Germans
came up with white flag; we let them come up
and then went out to take them. They then opened
fire just as their reinforcements came up, and killed
many men of the West Yorks, Notts and Derby, and
Durhams.</p>

<h4>(35)</h4>

<p>The same:&mdash;On the Monday morning we went out
to find our wounded and discovered an English soldier
with ten or fourteen bayonet wounds&mdash;there had been
no bayonet fighting with the Germans.</p>

<h4>(36)</h4>

<p>Private H&mdash;&mdash;, 2nd Batt. Duke of Wellington’s:&mdash;On
September 8th and 9th, at Nogent-sur-le-Marne,
advancing through the Forest of Crecy, heard on all
sides stories of women outraged. I was told by Mme.
S&mdash;&mdash; (Veuve) an elderly lady, who was the widow
of an Englishman and spoke English, that an officer
had outraged her servant in the house. The
servant stood by crying as Mme. S&mdash;&mdash; told the story.
Mme. S&mdash;&mdash; gave me her address&mdash;here it is in my
pocket-book:&mdash;4 rue de Lafaulette, Nogent-sur-le-Marne.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span></p>

<h4>(37)</h4>

<p>J. B&mdash;&mdash;, Despatch Rider, Signal Co. 1st Div.
R.E.:&mdash;About September 16th, near Paissy. At a
distance of about 300 yards we saw through our
glasses one of our despatch-riders (A&mdash;&mdash; of Signal
Co., R.E.), shot while riding his motor-cycle; he fell
off, and while lying on ground was speared by three
Uhlans, one after the other. Uhlans attempted to
burn him with his own petrol, but made off when
they saw us coming. We found his body half-burned
when we reached it.</p>

<h4>(38)</h4>

<p>Sergeant D&mdash;&mdash;, 1st Cornwalls:&mdash;About September
9th, near 6 p.m., Battle of the Aisne, I was with
a platoon with orders to remain behind and delay
German advance. We couldn’t see any Germans, and
we therefore had done no firing for quite an hour.
Our ambulance was out picking up wounded. My
platoon was marching back to rejoin our Company;
we were carrying our rifles. R.A.M.C. were picking
up Lieut. E&mdash;&mdash; when they were fired on from the
woods at a distance of about 300 yards, a regular
fusillade. Lieut. E&mdash;&mdash; badly hit. Ambulance had
to gallop off out of range, and we made off. Ambulance
was broadside on to the enemy, and must
therefore have been unmistakable.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span></p>

<h4>(39, 40 and 41)</h4>

<p>Statements taken down, after cross-examination by
a Staff Officer at General Headquarters, as to incidents
in the neighbourhood at Ypres:</p>

<p>(1) Private B. S&mdash;&mdash;, 1st Black Watch, says that
he saw Germans bayonet our wounded as they lay
on the ground. He was wounded in the leg himself,
but, seeing this, he managed to get away.</p>

<p>Afterwards he was with German wounded, who
told him that they had been ordered to kill all English
prisoners.</p>

<p>(2) Private W. W&mdash;&mdash;, 1st Black Watch, says that
he was in a reserve trench and saw the Germans
bayoneting our wounded 40 or 50 yards in front of
him. He was wounded in the arm and taken prisoner,
but was sent for water for wounded Germans
and escaped.</p>

<p>Says the wounded Germans in our charge told him
that they had been told to kill all English and take
no prisoners.</p>

<p>(3) Statement of Private M&mdash;&mdash;, Cameron Highlanders
attached.</p>

<p>I saw this man, and consider him thoroughly reliable
as to the facts of the case.</p>

<p>He says that he saw one German place the butt
of his rifle on the wounded man’s chest and hold him
while the other one shot him. Our reinforcements
were heard coming up immediately afterwards, and
the Germans ran away. The men were Prussian
Guard.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span></p>

<p>“I was shot while retiring, and took shelter behind
a hedge which I had fallen through. A
wounded man of the Black Watch was lying close
beside me groaning. The Germans came up behind
the hedge and fired through it. Two came through
and I saw one deliberately place his rifle to the
wounded Highlander’s head and shoot him. The
features of the wounded German who came into
hospital with me in the same convoy are identically
those of the man I saw commit the action.”</p>

<h4>(42 and 43)</h4>

<p>Summary of Statements taken by a Captain in the
Sherwood Foresters:</p>

<p>(1) The undermentioned privates state that on October
20th, 1914, they saw German soldiers killing
our wounded, and can swear to the same. [There
follow three names of privates in the 2nd Sherwood
Foresters.]</p>

<p>(2) The men mentioned below make the following
statement: that on November 1st, 1914, two German
soldiers were seen both delivering blows on our
wounded with rifle-butts, and shooting them. [There
follow names of four privates in the Lincolnshire
Regiment, and one in the Argyll and Sutherland
Highlanders.]</p>

<h4>(44)</h4>

<p>Statement made by a private in the Loyal North
Lancs.:</p>

<p>On or about December 21st, I think near Neuve
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
Chapelle, we were ordered up to the trenches occupied
by the Gurkhas. We got over them and lined
a ditch&mdash;some of ours wounded there. We charged,
and they started with hand bombs. On our right
was Captain Smart, shot in the head. We had to
retire; an hour and a half later we advanced again,
and here I found one of our wounded with his throat
cut (he had been shot previously). I heard of others
with their throats cut. I lay down close to him.
Dawn was just breaking. We had to retire again,
and the bodies were left there.</p>

<h4>(45)</h4>

<p>A Brigadier-General of the British Cavalry Corps:</p>

<p>On September 6th, the day before we got to Rebais,
we passed a lonely farm where we found a shepherd
with the top of his head blown off by a rifle-shot.
He had been asked by the Germans for bread, and,
on failing to produce any, had been shot.</p>

<h4>(46)</h4>

<p>Statement by Major &mdash;&mdash;, O.C. of a Cavalry Field
Ambulance:&mdash;On October 17th, at Moorslede, north-east
of Ypres, the Germans were reported as having
strangled a young baker in this place. The inhabitants
stated that he had been taken by the Germans
to bake for them, and that he attempted to escape.
The enemy caught him and stuffed a woollen scarf
he was wearing down his throat, causing suffocation.
One of my officers, Lieut. P&mdash;&mdash;, viewed the body in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
the convent next day, and found the scarf stuffed
in the man’s throat.</p>

<h4>(47)</h4>

<p>Private R. McK&mdash;&mdash;, 2nd Royal Irish:&mdash;On the advance
from the Marne to the Aisne in September,
we passed through a village and saw a baby propped
up at the window like a doll. About six of us went
into the house, with a sergeant, and found the child
dead&mdash;bayoneted. We found a tottering kind of old
man, a middle-aged woman, and a youth, all bayoneted.
In another village our interpreter pointed
out to us two girls who were crying; he told us they
had been ravished.</p>

<h4>(48)</h4>

<p>Driver B&mdash;&mdash;, R.F.A.:&mdash;Somewhere between Chantilly
and Villers-Cotterets, about the end of August,
just after we started advancing, we were marching
through a village, and the villagers called us into
a house and showed us the body of a middle-aged
man, with both arms cut off by a sword, pointed to
him and said “Allemands.” They told our R.A.M.C.
men in French that he had been killed when trying
to protect his daughter.</p>

<p>In the next village, before we got to the Aisne,
the villagers showed us the dead body of a woman,
naked, on the ground, badly mutilated, her breasts
cut off, and her body ripped up. They said
“Allemands.”
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span></p>

<h4>(49)</h4>

<p>Private F. W. M&mdash;&mdash;, Leicesters:&mdash;I think it was
in October, after we had left the Aisne and were
on the march. About a week before we got to Armenti&egrave;res,
we went through a small village, halted,
and I and a man named C&mdash;&mdash;, of my company, were
searching a hedge for wood, and came across a baby
with a single vest on it, as if it had been taken
straight from bed, and nearly cut in half, as if by a
sabre.</p>

<h4>(50)</h4>

<p>Private G. R&mdash;&mdash;, Bedfords:&mdash;Somewhere between
October 14th and 17th, at a village about fifteen
miles from Ypres, a boy was brought in from a
farm-house, the people having sent in for surgical
assistance for a boy who was wounded. I saw him
brought in by some of our men to an estaminet&mdash;he
had five sabre-cuts. His sister told us that the
Uhlans had chased him round the farm because he
had cried out something to them. He looked as if
he would not live. One of our R.A.M.C. bound up
his wounds.</p>

<h4>(51)</h4>

<p>Private W. D&mdash;&mdash;, Hampshires:&mdash;About seven
weeks ago, when the Germans tried hard to break
through, we were about two hours from a place
which we call the Ch&acirc;teau, where the Germans
pitched shells every day, especially at a big tower
place which is there. Our platoons were in the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
trenches in the order left to right of 5, 6, 7, 8, and
then came C Company in their trenches. The
wounded left with the dead in the C trench were
half buried by its having been blown in. The Germans
enfiladed the wounded, shot them, bayoneted
them, jumped on them.</p>

<h4>(52)</h4>

<p>Private B&mdash;&mdash;, Royal West Kents:&mdash;Early in September,
in the advance from Coulommiers, I saw two
British cavalrymen lying dead on the ground, their
arms stretched out like a cross and their hands
pinned by Uhlan lances.</p>

<h4>(53)</h4>

<p>Private J. C&mdash;&mdash;, Scots Guards:&mdash;Last Monday
night, the other side the canal bank at a place I
think they call “Karuchi,” the Manchesters were
surrounded. We were in support and advanced to
their help.... We re-took the trenches. In the second
trench, when we got there, we found many Manchesters
who had been shot first and then bayoneted,
as they lay wounded, by the Germans when capturing
the trench.</p>

<h4>(54)</h4>

<p>Private P&mdash;&mdash;, Cornwalls:&mdash;In the early part of
September in our advance, in all the villages the Germans
had smashed everything for mere sport&mdash;the
place stank with the dead bodies of pigs and chickens
which they had killed and left in the road. We found
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
scent-bottles thrown all over the road&mdash;mirrors
smashed and furniture&mdash;lovely furniture&mdash;thrown
into the street, and pictures cut.</p>

<h4>(55)</h4>

<p>Private W. T&mdash;&mdash;, Welsh Regiment:&mdash;On the retreat
from Mons in August we came upon a woman
tied to a tree. She was quite dead. Her throat was
cut. I believe she had been outraged.... The time
was about 5 p.m. It was quite light. I should say
the woman’s age was between eighteen and twenty-two.
The men cut her down. I saw them do it. I
do not know what became of the body as we had to
go on. I expect it was Uhlans who had done this.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le 10 septembre courant, en parcourant avec quelques
gendarmes de mon d&eacute;tachement, en ex&eacute;cution
de l’Art. 109 du Service de la Gendarmerie en campagne
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
(31 juillet, 1911), un terrain sur lequel avait
eu lieu la veille, un engagement, j’ai fait, au lieu
dit “Laroche,” commune de Montreuil-aux-Lions
(Seine-et-Marne) les constatations suivantes:</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Un soldat d’infanterie anglaise avait &eacute;t&eacute; tu&eacute; sur
la lisi&egrave;re d’un petit-bois bordant la route de Mery &agrave;
Montreuil-aux-Lions.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il avait &eacute;t&eacute; atteint par des balles de fusil, au cou
et &agrave; la poitrine.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il &eacute;tait tomb&eacute; et &eacute;tait rest&eacute; &eacute;tendu sur le dos.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Son cadavre fut mutil&eacute; la face avait &eacute;t&eacute; compl&egrave;tement
aplatie et &eacute;crase&eacute;, tr&egrave;s probablement par des
coups donn&eacute;s avec la crosse d’un fusil ou m&ecirc;me avec
le talon de la chaussure.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Cet acte fut certainement commis par des soldats
allemands du 48 regiment d’Infanterie, car six cadavres
d’Allemands de ce m&ecirc;me r&eacute;giment furent trouv&eacute;s
&agrave; 100 m&egrave;tres au plus de cet endroit.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Une femme se trouvait sur la route tout pr&egrave;s de
l&agrave;. Des qu’elle me vit elle s’approcha de moi et
encore sous le coup d’une vive indignation elle me fit
le r&eacute;cit suivant:</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Hier, 9 septembre, dans l’apr&egrave;s-midi, pendant
le combat un soldat fut bless&eacute;. Il avait &eacute;t&eacute; atteint
&agrave; une jambe. Malgr&eacute; sa blessure, il parvint &agrave; se
tra&icirc;ner jusque chez moi, &agrave; la maison que vous voyez
sur la colline, au lieu dit Pisseloup.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Il me parla, je ne le compris pas.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Je lui fis un premier pansement d&egrave;s qu’il en e&ucirc;t
montr&eacute; sa blessure et le fis &eacute;tendre sur mon lit.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Quelques instants apr&egrave;s plusieurs soldats allemands
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
travers&egrave;rent la route et vinrent &eacute;galement
jusqu’&agrave; ma demeure.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“D&egrave;s qu’ils virent le soldat anglais qui &eacute;tait bless&eacute;,
ils le frapp&egrave;rent, le jet&egrave;rent dehors de la maison, o&ugrave;
ils le battirent encore avec leurs fusils.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">“Je ne sais ce qu’est devenu ce malheureux anglais,
mais je pense qu’il a d&ucirc; &ecirc;tre recueilli ou enterr&eacute;, s’il
est mort, par ses compatriotes qui sont pass&eacute;s ici ce
matin, out soigne des bless&eacute;s et enterr&eacute; quelques-uns
des leurs tir&eacute;s dans le combat de hier.”</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Enfin, j’ajoute le fait suivant:</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">A Vanfleurs, le 8 septembre pr&egrave;s de Poccunente,
j’ai encore vu sur la colline au N.O. de Poccunente,
et &agrave; 1 Kilo, environ, le cadavre d’un Anglais dont
le cr&acirc;ne avait &eacute;t&eacute; mutil&eacute; &agrave; un tel point que la mati&egrave;re
cervicale apparaissait en plusieurs points.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ce soldat anglais &eacute;tait un simple &eacute;claireur, tu&eacute; d’un
coup de fusil &agrave; la lisi&egrave;re d’un bois.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Les Allemands s’&eacute;taient acharn&eacute;s apr&egrave;s lui, peut-&ecirc;tre
m&ecirc;me apr&egrave;s sa mort.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Ces actes constituent peut-&ecirc;tre une exception et
sont l’œuvre de brutes, mais ils sont tellement odieux
que j’estime de mon devoir d’en rendre compte &agrave;
l’autorit&eacute; militaire sup&eacute;rieure.</p>

combattants par des soldats allemands</em></h4>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">L’an 1914, le 16 octobre &agrave; 16 heures Nous Th&eacute;venin....
Inform&eacute; par les agents de notre service
que les soldats allemands auraient tu&eacute; trois individus
non combattants au lieu dit Nouveau Monde, commune
de Bailleul, nous avons ouvert une enqu&ecirc;te et
entendons:</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Marie H&mdash;&mdash;, 37 ans, &eacute;pouse C&mdash;&mdash;, demeurant &agrave;
V&mdash;&mdash; Rue, Commune de Bailleul, entendue, d&eacute;clare:&mdash;Le
jeudi matin, 8 courant, vers 7 heures je me
trouvais au passage &agrave; niveau du Nouveau Monde,
quand j’ai vu passer trois civils accompagn&eacute;s par six
soldats allemands, ba&iuml;onnette au canon et qui leur
avaient attach&eacute; les mains avec des serviettes. Je les
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
ai suivi du regard et quelques minutes apr&egrave;s j’ai vu
les m&ecirc;mes soldats accompagnant les m&ecirc;mes hommes
parler &agrave; un officier allemand qui leur a fait signe
d’aller plus loin dans une p&acirc;ture. Les soldats s’y
sont dirig&eacute;s conduisant toujours les civils prisonniers;
ils leur ont fait sauter un foss&eacute;, puis ils les
ont mis debout sur une m&ecirc;me ligne dans la prairie.
&Agrave; ce moment un soldat allemand me fit rentrer dans
une maison. Environ une demi heure apr&egrave;s, j’ai su
que les Allemands avaient tu&eacute; les civils que j’avais
vu passer avec eux et qu’ils les avaient enterr&eacute;s dans
le jardin de Monsieur Pierre B&eacute;haghel.</p>

courant, vers 7 heures et demie du matin six soldats
allemands amenant avec eux, les mains li&eacute;es, trois
civils portant de petits paquets et paraissant avoir
de 18 &agrave; 25 ans. Ils les ont mis dans la prairie en
face de chez moi sur l’ordre que venait de leur donner
un de leurs officiers auxquels ils venaient de
s’adresser. J’avais chez moi un soldat allemand qui
faisait la cuisine et cet homme voyant venir les
prisonniers m’a dit, en fran&ccedil;ais: “<em>Regardez,
Madame, comme c’est beau: voir fusilier des civils
fran&ccedil;ais, regardez c’est du beau travail, on devrait
tous les tuer comme cela!</em>” J’ai r&eacute;pondu que je ne
pouvais pas le voir car c’&eacute;tait un crime. Malgr&eacute; ma
r&eacute;ponse j’ai regard&eacute; lorsque j’ai entendu tirer le coup
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
de feu et j’ai vu que ces pauvres civils tombaient.

portaient des paquets. L’officier a dit en fran&ccedil;ais

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le jeudi, 8 octobre courant, vers midi, mon fils
Albert, 19 ans, venait d’apprendre que des patrouilles
allemandes circulaient dans le voisinage de notre
ferme. Il m’en fit part et me dit qu’il allait aussit&ocirc;t
se cacher dans un fosse. Il est parti de suite suivi
de son fr&egrave;re Maurice, &acirc;g&eacute; de 17 ans. Le m&ecirc;me jour,
vers 8 heures du soir, celui-ci revint &agrave; la maison, il
me dit que son fr&egrave;re l’avait quitt&eacute; pour aller &agrave; la
ferme occup&eacute;e par les &eacute;poux Charlet, nos voisins.
Je suis all&eacute; aussit&ocirc;t voir mon voisin, C&mdash;&mdash; D&mdash;&mdash;,
que je savais avoir pass&eacute; la journ&eacute;e chez Charlet et
celui-ci me dit que mon fils avait &eacute;t&eacute; tu&eacute; dans la
ferme Charlet &agrave; coup de lance par un soldat allemand.
Je ne sais pas autre chose sinon que j’ai vu
le cadavre de mon fils dans la cour de cette ferme &agrave;
moiti&eacute; carbonis&eacute; par l’incendie que venait de d&eacute;truire

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Le 8 octobre, vers 3 heures du soir, je me trouvais
&agrave; la ferme Charlet avec diff&eacute;rentes personnes dont le
nomm&eacute; B&mdash;&mdash;, Albert. Les Allemands au nombre
d’une dizaine, sont entr&eacute;s dans la maison absolument
furieux et se sont ru&eacute;s sur nous hommes et femmes
sans distinction, nous ont appr&eacute;hend&eacute;s au corps pour
nous jeter dans la cour de la ferme, o&ugrave; ils allaient
nous fusilier, disaient-ils. Le jeune B&mdash;&mdash; fut jet&eacute;
le premier. Un soldat qui &eacute;tait &agrave; l’entr&eacute;e le per&ccedil;a
d’un coup de lance qui le tua. B&mdash;&mdash; tomba raide
mort &agrave; terre. Dans la cour, j’ai vu que les b&acirc;timents
de la ferme flambaient. Les Allemands nous ont dit
qu’ils venaient d’allumer cet incendie, car ils croyaient
qu’un coup de feu avait &eacute;t&eacute; tir&eacute; de l&agrave; sur eux.
Tous, nous avons suppli&eacute; les Allemands de ne pas
nous faire du mal. Un d’entr’eux qui causait fran&ccedil;ais
a fait part aux autres de ce que nous voulions.
Alors, on nous a jet&eacute; la t&ecirc;te apr&egrave;s les murs, on nous a
bouscul&eacute;s tant qu’ils ont pu et on nous a mis dehors de
la ferme. Je ne sais pas autre chose sur cette affaire.</p>

que nous puissions en faire autant qu’&agrave; vous-m&ecirc;me.</em>”

au bout d’un quart d’heure ils se sont d&eacute;coiff&eacute;s, puis
se sont mis &agrave; genoux. Comme ils se relevaient, j’ai
entendu une fusillade et au m&ecirc;me moment, ils
tombaient tous dans le trou qu’ils venaient de creuser.

30 du matin, les Allemands qui occupaient notre pays
d&eacute;j&agrave; depuis plusieurs jours sont venus chez moi. Ils
ont cass&eacute; les persiennes, puis les carreaux de vitres
des deux fen&ecirc;tres qui se trouvent sur la rue. M’&eacute;tant
alors lev&eacute;, ils m’ont dit que je devais partir et qu’ils
allaient br&ucirc;ler ma maison. Les rideaux de ces deux
fen&ecirc;tres ont en effet &eacute;t&eacute; br&ucirc;l&eacute;s. En sortant de mon
habitation, j’ai re&ccedil;u un coup de poing sur la figure,
puis aussit&ocirc;t un coup de crosse sur le c&ocirc;t&eacute; de l’œil,
puis un droit sur la t&ecirc;te. Devant ces brutalit&eacute;s, je
me suis sauv&eacute; &agrave; la ferme de mon voisin Ridez, situ&eacute;e
&agrave; environ 30 m&egrave;tres en face de ma demeure. Au
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
moment o&ugrave; j’entrais dans la cour de cette ferme,
j’ai entendu une d&eacute;tonation et imm&eacute;diatement j’ai
remarqu&eacute; que mon bras droit tombait naturellement.
Je ne ressentais aucun mal. Ce n’est qu’&agrave; mon
entr&eacute;e dans cette ferme que j’ai constat&eacute; que j’avais
le bras droit cass&eacute;. J’ignore quel &eacute;tait le but de ces
violences, puisque je n’avais rien fait ni rien dit.
C’est Monsieur le Docteur Poti&eacute; de Vieux-Berquin
qui me donne des soins. En ce qui concerne le vol
et le pillage tant chez moi que chez mes voisins, je
certifie que ce sont les Allemands qui ont tout pris.

trouvait r&eacute;unie dans l’&eacute;glise, les femmes et les enfants
furent expedi&eacute;s vers le couvent des religieuses,
tandis que les hommes (au nombre de 400), furent
oblig&eacute;s de se diriger par rangs de quatre vers la
plaine, et entre une double haie de soldats allemands.
Pendant cette marche les soldats allemands ne cess&egrave;rent
de tirer sur nous et de cette fa&ccedil;on massacr&egrave;rent
impitoyablement un nombre consid&eacute;rable de mes
concitoyens.</p>

<p lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Voyant que nombre de mes camarades tombaient,
abattus par les coups de feu, je me suis laiss&eacute; tomber
&agrave; terre, quoique je n’&eacute;tais pas bless&eacute;, et je suis rest&eacute;
l&agrave;, immobile, couch&eacute; sous les cadavres jusque vers
le milieu de la nuit suivante; c’est ainsi que j’ai
sauv&eacute; ma vie. Le lendemain matin, lorsque je me
suis relev&eacute;, j’ai constat&eacute; que nous &eacute;tions &agrave; peine trente
habitants qui avions &eacute;chapp&eacute; au massacre, mais la
plupart des autres &eacute;chapp&eacute;s &eacute;taient bless&eacute;s; cinq

avons &eacute;t&eacute; forc&eacute;s d’inhumer les cadavres de nos 350
concitoyens, puis amen&eacute;s &agrave; une distance de 5 kilom&egrave;tres;
l&agrave; on nous remit en libert&eacute; mais avec d&eacute;fense
formelle de remettre encore le pied dans notre

FIVE GERMAN DIARIES</h3>

<p class="hang large">(<em>a</em>) Extract from the Diary of a German Soldier
forwarded by the Extraordinary Commission
of Enquiry instituted by the Russian Government.</p>

<p>“When the offensive becomes difficult we gather
together the Russian prisoners and hunt them before
us towards their compatriots, while we attack
the latter at the same time. In this way our losses
are sensibly diminished.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span></p>

<p>“We cannot but make prisoners. Each Russian

soldier when made prisoner will now be sent in front
of our lines in order to be shot by his fellows.”</p>

German warrior who has been through everything
from the start and has shot and bayoneted so many
Frenchmen, and I have bayoneted many women.
During the fight at Batonville [?Badonviller] I bayoneted
seven (7) women and four (4) young girls in
five (5) minutes. We fought from house to house
and these women fired on us with revolvers; they
also fired on the captain too, then he told me to shoot

<h3 id="DOCUMENTS_FORWARDED_BY_THE_RUSSIAN_GOVERNMENT">VI</h3>

<p class="hang">DOCUMENTS SELECTED FROM THE REPORTS OF THE EXTRAORDINARY
COMMISSION OF INQUIRY APPOINTED
BY HIS MAJESTY THE EMPEROR OF RUSSIA</p>

<h4>I. Violation of a Sister of Mercy.</h4>

<p>A Sister of Mercy, wearing the sign of the Red
Cross, was seized by German and Austrian troops
on April 20th, 1915, at the station of Radzivilishki
and shut up in a cart-shed.</p>

<p>“On the fourth day several officers visited her in
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
the cart-shed and demanded information from her
as to the positions of the Russian troops. They then
beat her with swords and pricked her body with
needles. On the same day she was taken to the third
line of German entrenchments and lodged in a ‘dug-out’
occupied by German officers. Here she was
violated, and during a week and a half several German
officers frequently committed violent acts of
copulation with her, and kept her in the ‘dug-out’
without clothes under a special guard. At last she
succeeded in escaping from the trenches. With the
help of a Lithuanian peasant she made her way to
the Russian positions, where she arrived in an almost
unconscious state. First medical aid was at
once administered, as it was found she was suffering
from inflammation of the peritoneum and cellular
membrane surrounding the matrix. On examining
her for marks of violence, bruises were visible in the
region of the shoulder and on the thighs and legs.”</p>

<h4>II. Violation of a Girl.</h4>

<p>At the beginning of the war, when the Germans
entered the town of Kalish, a girl named X&mdash;&mdash; was
arrested and led out to the public place, or square,
for execution. Here the Germans tied her to a tree
and told her that she would be shot. Others of the
inhabitants, also condemned to be shot, were drawn
up on the same open space. Among these victims
was an acquaintance of the girl X&mdash;&mdash;, a student
named N. Davuidov. The German soldiers proceeded
to stab this Davuidov with their bayonets before the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
very eyes of the girl X&mdash;&mdash;, and then they tore out
hair from his head and finally shot him dead. This
scene of murder gave the girl such a shock that she
fainted. On coming to her senses she found herself
in an apartment occupied by German officers. No
sooner did she revive, than one of these officers committed
a rape upon her and destroyed her virginity.
During the following days she remained a captive
in the same apartment, where she was forced to yield
to the brutal lust of the officer who first violated her,
and to the solicitations of two of his comrades, who
threatened to cut her to pieces with their swords if
she offered any resistance. These officers then told
her “that the Germans had invented a new method
of making war on the Russians, which would exterminate
them by means of poisonous gas without the
waste of any more bullets.”</p>

<p>The girl was subsequently rescued by the Russian
troops.</p>

<p>A combined judicial and medical examination of
the girl X&mdash;&mdash; on June 4th, established the fact that
she had been deprived of her maidenhood and an
inflammatory condition of the sexual organs was still
plainly visible.</p>

<h4>III. Murder of Wounded Soldiers.</h4>

<p>On April 25th, 1915, when an infantry regiment
retreated from the station of Krosno in Galicia, the
unarmed wounded soldiers, who were unable to follow,
and many of whom were crawling away on their
hands and knees, were overtaken and stabbed to
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
death, or despatched by blows with the butt end
of rifles by the Austro-Hungarian troops.</p>

<p>The foregoing facts have been confirmed by the
evidence of junior subaltern B&mdash;&mdash; of the regiment,
Serge Yakovlev Sudarikov, aged thirty, who was
interrogated as a witness by the Examining Magistrate
of the 1st ward of Kharkov.</p>

<h4>IV. Murder of Wounded Soldiers.</h4>

<p>On May 12th, 1915, near the village of Bobrovka,
forty versts from Yaroslav in Galicia, after the withdrawal
of the “platoon sotnias” of dismounted cossacks
from their trenches, the latter were occupied
by German guardsmen, who drove out the Russian
wounded at the point of the bayonet.</p>

<p>Private Nikita Davidenko, who was one hundred
paces from the trenches taken by the Germans, saw
how they used their bayonets to thrust out four or
five of his wounded comrades, whose groans were
distinctly audible.</p>

<p>When the Russian troops advanced on May 15th,
Davidenko saw the bodies of many cossacks, who had
been bayoneted or sabred to death in the trenches
abandoned on May 12th.</p>

<p>The above facts have been confirmed by the evidence
of Davidenko, who was interrogated as a witness
by the Examining Magistrate of the second ward
of Kharkov.</p>

<h4>V. Murder of Wounded Soldiers.</h4>

<p>On the retirement of the Russians, after the battle
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span>
near Gumbinnen, in Eastern Prussia, August 7th,
1914, a junior subaltern, named Alexander Lappo,
aged twenty-six, who had been wounded in the back
by a piece of an exploded shrapnel, was left behind,
lying on the field.</p>

<p>He soon perceived a group of about fifteen Germans,
headed by an officer and a colour sergeant,
following up their detachments, and shooting all the
wounded Russians within reach as they marched
along. There was no consideration for the fact that
these Russians had been struck down at a considerable
distance from the actual fighting, without having
fired a shot. One of the Germans in this squad
caught sight of Lappo and fired at him with his rifle.
Lappo received the bullet in his left elbow. A second
shot, fired by the same German soldier, hit a
wounded Russian private Tartar, lying next to Lappo.
The Tartar made one or two convulsive movements
and expired. The pain from the wound in his elbow
made Lappo moan rather loudly, and this attracted
the attention of the German officer, who at once
levelled his revolver and shot him in the neck. This
second wound rendered Lappo unconscious and he
only recovered his senses towards evening, when he
was picked up by Russian Red Cross men. Lappo
then noticed that his leather wrist band with a black
watch, worth ten roubles, had been stolen, evidently
by the Germans.</p>

<p>It is not certain to what troops of the enemy’s
forces this German officer and the men under his
command belonged, but the German soldiers killed
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
in the battle near Stalupenen, on August 4th, 1914,
in which Lappo took part, had the figures “41” on
their shoulder straps.</p>

<p>The above described facts have been verified and
established by a combined judicial and medical examination,
and by the evidence of Lappo, given under
oath before the Examining Magistrate of the
Circuit Court of Vitebsk, district of Gorodok.</p>

<h4>VI. Burning the Russian Wounded.</h4>

<h5><em>Evidence of the Private Nicholas Semenov Dorozhka</em></h5>

<p>In the latter half of June the regiment in which
this witness was one of the rank and file took part
in a battle near Ivangorod. When the fighting was
over, the regiment settled down to rest. Some of
the men, however, went to help the sanitary attendants
to bring in the wounded and place them in a
wooden cart-house or shed, roofed with straw, at
one end of the village. According to statements made
by the Red Cross bearers, from sixty-six to sixty-eight
men were lodged in this building. At eleven
o’clock at night there was a sudden and violent rattle
of rifle fire. The village had been surrounded
by the Germans. The witness seized his rifle and
started to leave with three comrades, but in the darkness
they stumbled into a German trench, and were
taken prisoners. Their weapons were taken from
them, and all four Russians were led to the same
cart-shed, to which the witness Dorozhka had assisted
to carry the Russian wounded. A German officer
on the spot gave an order to his German soldiers
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
and then he gathered up an armful of the straw,
littered over the floor of the shed, placed it against
one of the corners of the building, and set fire to it
with a match. The witness declares, that he almost
fainted when he saw this officer setting fire to the
shed. The straw blazed up at once, the flames began
to envelop the wooden walls, and when it reached
the roof, piercing shrieks came from the wounded inmates,
calling for help. At this moment the officer
who fired the shed approached the prisoners, who
were standing near, and without uttering a word,
he discharged his revolver point blank at one of the
comrades of the witness, who instantly fell to the
ground dead. Then this officer struck witness’s other
comrade with something in the lower part of the
body, and by the light of the conflagration witness
noticed that the man’s intestines were protruding.
Dorozhka rushed to one side and managed to break
away from a group of German soldiers and escaped
unhurt, although three shots were fired after him.
The witness, after tramping all night, fell in with
one of the Russian pickets.</p>

<p>The foregoing was deposed to by the witness
Dorozhka on examination by the Examining Magistrate
of the 1st Dnieprovsky District.</p>

<h4>VII. Ill-Treatment of Prisoners of War.</h4>

<p>In June, 1915, three Russian officers, Captain
Kosmachevsky, Lieutenant Griaznov, and Sub-lieutenant
Yarotsky, escaped from German captivity and
reached Russia in safety.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span></p>

<p>They were made prisoners in East Prussia in August,
1914. Together with other captured officers,
they were driven on foot to the town of Neidenburg,
and at one place on the way were made to serve
as cover for a German battery, which was in danger
of attack from Russian artillery fire.</p>

<p>For this purpose the prisoners were put into two-wheeled
carts and ordered to wave white flags and
flags with the Red Cross, and these carts were placed
in front of the battery. At the same time the prisoners
were warned, that if only a single projectile
fell into this German battery, they would all be shot
for it.</p>

<p>Four days these prisoners were on the march. At
night they were compelled to sleep in the open in
roadside ditches, although there were villages near
by, and all that time they received no food, but only
coffee, without sugar, milk or bread, served up in
pails. Along the road the inhabitants and troops
whom they met cursed and insulted them, tore off
their shoulder straps, threatened them with their fists,
spat at them and shouted “To Berlin!”</p>

<p>Before the prisoners were put into the train they
were searched, and in this way many of them lost
their gold watches and money. The Cossack officers
especially were subjected to very strict search, in
the course of which they were stripped naked. These
Cossack officers were separated from the others and
sent off with the private soldier prisoners.</p>

<p>In the first instance the officer prisoners were interned
in the fortress of Neisse in Silesia, and were
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
subsequently removed to Kreisfeld, beyond the Rhine.</p>

<p>The prisoners, according to their own account, were
kept in horrible conditions. They were lodged in
dirty barracks where the windows were shut fast
and the glass of the panes covered with oil paint.
It was forbidden to approach these windows under
pain of being fired at by the sentries. This threat
was once carried out, when an officer wished to make
a drawing at one of the windows. Fortunately nobody
was hurt. The imprisoned officers had to sleep
in dirty beds full of bugs, lice, and other vermin.
Their meagre fare was served up on dirty tables,
littered with straw, whilst alongside were other tables,
covered with clean tablecloths and decently furnished
even to the extent of glasses for beer, and on
these tables dinner was served for the sentries, German
subalterns, who looked on at the prisoners and
their wretched accommodation in the most insolent
manner.</p>

<p>All the imprisoned officers were formed into companies,
commanded by rough and rude sergeant-majors,
who treated them like common soldiers.</p>

<p>In November, 1914, two of the officer prisoners attempted
to escape by bribing the shopman at the
stores of the officers’ canteen. This shopman, however,
turned out to be a German officer in disguise,
and the attempt failed, but it cost the officers concerned
very dear. They were put in irons and kept
in prison six months in a far worse state than in the
barracks.</p>

<p>The above is attested by the evidence of Captain
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
Kosmachevsky, Lieutenant Griaznov, and Sub-lieutenant
Yarotsky, given to Major-General Semashko,
a member of the Extraordinary Commission of Inquiry,
and the deponents were admonished that they
would be required to swear to the truth of their
statements.</p>

<h4>VIII.</h4>

<p>Peter Shimchak, a peasant from the province of
Warsaw, who fled from German captivity, being examined
on oath, deposed to the following:&mdash;In August
I was made prisoner while serving as a sailor
on board a vessel under the British flag, going from
Denmark to England.</p>

<p>As a Russian subject I was not set free, but was
placed in solitary confinement for seven days in
a prison at Hamburg, and then sent to a camp for
prisoners of war near Berlin, at Zel, where there
were already many English, French, and Belgian
prisoners. In that camp there was a small yard
where offending prisoners were generally punished.
On one occasion four Cossacks were brought into
the camp. I recognised them by the yellow stripes
down the sides of their trousers. They were taken
out into the yard and placed about ten feet from
the wall of the barrack, and through the crevices
I was able to watch the proceedings. They took the
first Cossack and placed his left hand on a small
wooden post or block, and with a sword bayonet one
of the German soldiers chopped off successively half
of the Cossack’s thumb, half of his middle finger and
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
half of his little finger. I could plainly see how
these finger pieces flew off at each stroke of the
sword-bayonet and fell to the ground. The Germans
picked them up and put them into the pocket of the
Cossack’s overcoat and then took him into a barrack,
where there was a reservoir of running water.
The second Cossack was brought up and had holes
drilled through his ears, the point of the sword-bayonet
being turned in the cut several times in
order, evidently, to make the hole as large as possible.
This Cossack was then led away to the barrack
where the first one had been taken. When
the third Cossack was brought to the place of torture
his nose was chopped off by a downward stroke
of a sword bayonet, but as the severed piece of nose
was still hanging by a bit of skin, the Cossack made
signs that they should cut it off completely. The Germans
then gave him a pocket knife, and with this
the Cossack cut off the hanging piece of his nose.
Finally, the fourth Cossack was brought forward.
What they intended to do with him it was impossible
to say, but this Cossack with a rapid movement
drew out the bayonet of the nearest soldier and
dealt a blow with it at one of the Germans. There
were about fifteen German soldiers present, and they
all set upon this Cossack and bayoneted him to death,
after which they dragged the body outside the camp.
What was the fate of the remaining three Cossacks
I do not know, but I think, says the witness Shimchak,
in concluding his account of the case, they must have
been also killed, for I never saw them again.

<h4>IX.</h4>

<p>Evidence of the senior surgeon of the 73rd Artillery
Brigade, Gregory Dimitrovich Onisimov, who
was captured by the enemy on August 30th, 1914,
near “Malvishek” in East Prussia, but has since been
released. The most striking and characteristic part
of this ex-prisoner’s testimony is a description of the
insulting treatment received by Russian prisoners
from the soldiers of their German escort on the road
to Insterburg. “The peaceful temper of our German
convoy did not last long. We soon began to
meet detachments of German troops, who swore and
shook their fists and levelled their rifles and revolvers
at us, shouting, ‘Why lead these men about when
they can be settled here on the spot?’ This kind
of remark was shouted at us in German, Polish, and
broken Russian. The peaceful inhabitants also reviled
us, and called upon the soldiers to despatch
us there and then. They shouted ‘nach Berlin&mdash;to
Berlin with them! ... to Welhau! ... Russischer
schweinhund&mdash;Russian swine,’ and so forth. The
soldiers of the escort were taken into houses on the
road and made drunk, so that they also began to
amuse themselves at our expense. The German soldier
walking on my right took his rifle from his shoulder,
as if tired, and held it in such a way that the
muzzle touched my right temple, and then he played
carelessly with the lock of it, as though unaware of
what he was doing. When I moved out of the way,
he said: ‘Ah! you’re afraid of losing your head,
there’s no danger.’ As soon as the guard on one
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span>
side had had his little joke, his comrade on the other
side began. Another soldier on a cart came along
purposely handling his rifle so as to stick the muzzle
into my chest, and when I warded it off he roared
with laughter and seemed highly delighted. When
going down a steep part of the road the driver of
a cart behind intentionally drove into us and struck
me on the legs with the shafts. I shouted to him
to stop and not break my legs. He simply replied:
‘Bad to have no legs.’ This kind of thing went on
throughout the march. Sometimes we were driven
forward like horses, and the wounded men in the
carts were so shaken about that they groaned with
pain. The guards did not allow us to turn round
to speak with them, and no attention was paid to
our entreaties to drive them slowly.”</p>

THE GERMAN WHITE BOOK</h3>

<h4>The Introductory Memorandum.</h4>

<p>Immediately after the outbreak of the present war
there arose in Belgium a violent struggle by the people
against the German troops which forms a flagrant
violation of international law and has had the most
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
serious consequences to the Belgian country and
people.</p>

<p>This struggle of a population which was under
the dominion of the wildest passions continued to
rage throughout the whole of the advance of the
German army through Belgium. As the Belgian
army fell back before the German troops after obstinately
contested engagements, the Belgian civil
population attempted by every means to impede the
German advance in those parts of the country which
were not yet occupied; but they did not scruple to
injure and weaken the German forces by cowardly
and treacherous attacks, also in places which had
long been occupied by the German troops. The extent
of this armed popular resistance can be seen
from the attached general plan (Appendix 1) on
which were marked the lines of the German advance,
and the Belgian places in which the popular struggle
chiefly raged. We have an overwhelming amount
of material resting on official sources, especially on
evidence given under oath and official reports, that
on these routes and in these places the Belgian civil
population of every rank, age, and sex took part
in the struggle against the German troops with the
greatest bitterness and fury. In the Appendices is
given a selection from this material which, however,
embraces only the more important events and
can at any time be increased by further documents.</p>

<p>According to the attached material the Belgian
civil population fought against the German troops
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
in numerous places in the provinces of Li&egrave;ge (Appendices
2-10), Luxembourg (Appendices 11-30),
Namur (Appendices 12, 17, 31-42), Henegau (Appendices
3, 7, 10, 40, 43-46, 49), Brabant (Appendices
47-49), East and West Flanders (Appendices
49, 50). The conflicts in Aerschot, Andenne, Dinant,
Louvain assumed a particularly frightful character,
and special reports have been provided on them by
the Bureau which has been appointed in the Ministry
of War for investigation of offences against
the laws of war (Appendices A, B, C, D). Men of
the most different positions, workmen, manufacturers,
doctors, teachers, even clergy, and even women
and children were seized with weapons in their hands
(Appendices 18, 20, 25, 27, 43, 47; A 5; C 18, 26, 29,
31, 41, 42-44, 56, 62; D 1, 19, 34, 37, 38, 41, 45, 48).
In districts from which the Belgian regular troops
had long retired, the German troops were fired on
from houses and gardens, from roofs and cellars,
from fields and woods. Methods were used in the
struggle which certainly would not have been employed
by regular troops, and large numbers of sporting
weapons and sporting ammunition and some old-fashioned
revolvers and pistols were discovered (Appendices
6, 11, 13, 26, 36, 37, 44, 48, 49; A 2, C 52,
81; D 1, 2, 6, 20, 37). Corresponding with this were
numerous cases of wounds by shot and also by burns
from hot tar and boiling water (Appendices 3, 10;
B 2; C 5, 11, 28, 57; D 25, 29). According to all this
evidence there can be no doubt that in Belgium the
People’s War (<em lang="de" xml:lang="de">Volkskrieg</em>) was carried on not only
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
by individual civilians, but by great masses of the
population.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The conduct of the war by the Belgian civil population
was completely irreconcilable with the generally
recognised rules of international law as they
have found expression in Articles 1 and 2 of The
Hague Convention: The Laws and Customs of War
on Land, which had been accepted by Belgium.
These regulations distinguished between organised
and unorganised People’s War. In an organised
People’s War (Article 1), in order that they may
be recognised as belligerents, the militia and volunteer
corps must satisfy each of the following conditions:
They must have responsible leaders at their
head; they must bear a definite badge which is recognisable
at a distance; they must bear their weapons
openly; and they must obey the laws and usages
of war. The unorganised People’s War (Article 2)
can dispense with the first two conditions, that is,
responsible leaders and military badges. It is, however,
bound instead by two other conditions; it can
only be carried on in that part of the territory which
has not yet been occupied by the enemy, and there
must have been no time for the organisation of the
People’s War.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The two special conditions required for the organised
People’s War were certainly not present in
the case of the Belgian <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</em>. For, according
to the reports of the German military commands,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
which agree with one another, the civil persons who
were found taking part in the struggle had no responsible
leaders at their head, and also wore no
kind of military badge (Appendices 6, 49; C 4-7, 14,
15, 22, 24, 25, 31; D). The Belgian <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</em>
can therefore not be regarded as organised militia
or volunteers according to the laws of war. It makes
no difference in this, that apparently Belgian military
and members of the Belgian “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Garde Civique</span>”
also took part in their enterprises; for as these individuals
also did not wear any military badge but
mingled among the fighting citizens in civilian dress
(Appendices 6; A 3; C 25; D 1, 30, 45, 46), the
rights of belligerents can just as little be conceded
to them.</p>

<p>The whole of the Belgian People’s War must
therefore be judged from the point of view of an
unorganised armed resistance of the civil population.
As such resistance is only allowed in unoccupied
territory, it was for this reason alone, without
any doubt, contrary to international law in all
those places which were already in occupation of
German troops, and particularly at Aerschot, Andenne,
and Louvain. But the unorganised People’s
War was also impermissible in those places which
had not yet been occupied by German troops, and
particularly in Dinant and the neighbourhood, as
the Belgian Government had sufficient time for an
organisation of the People’s War as required by international
law. For years the Belgian Government
has had under consideration that at the outbreak
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
of a Franco-German war it would be involved in the
operations; the preparation of mobilisation began, as
can be proved, at least a week before the invasion of
the German army. The Government was therefore
completely in a position to provide the civil population
with military badges and appoint responsible
leaders, so far as they wished to use their services
in any fighting which might take place. If the Belgian
Government in a communication which has been
communicated to the German Government through
a neutral Power, maintain that they took suitable
measures, this only proves that they could have satisfied
the conditions which had been laid down; in
any case, however, such steps were not taken in those
districts through which the German troops passed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The requirements of international law for an unorganised
People’s War were then not complied with
in Belgium; moreover, this war was carried on in
a manner which alone would have been sufficient to
have put those who took part in it outside the laws
of war. For the Belgian <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</em> regularly carried
their weapons not openly, and throughout failed
to observe the laws and usages of war.</p>

<p>It has been shown by unanswerable evidence that
in a whole series of cases the German troops were
on their arrival received by the Belgian civil population
in an apparently friendly manner, and then,
when darkness came on or some other opportunity
presented itself, were attacked with arms; such cases
occurred especially in Blegny, Esneux, Grand Ros&egrave;re,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
Bi&egrave;vre, Gouvy, Villers devant Orval, Sainte Marie,
Les Bulles, Yschippe, Acoz, Aerschot, Andenne, and
Louvain (Appendices 3, 8, 11-13, 18, 22, 28, 31, 43;
A, B, D). All these attacks obviously offended
against the precept of international law that arms
should be borne openly.</p>

<p>What, however, is the chief accusation against the
Belgian population is the unheard-of violation of the
usages of war. In different places, for instance, at
Li&eacute;ge, Herve, Brussels, at Aerschot, Dinant, and
Louvain, German soldiers were treacherously murdered
(Appendices 18, 55, 61, 65, 66; A 1; C 56, 59,
61, 67, 73-78), which is contrary to the prohibition
“to kill or treacherously wound individuals belonging
to the hostile nation or army.” (Article 23,
Section 1 (<em>b</em>) of The Hague Convention: The Laws
and Customs of War on Land.) Further, the Belgian
population did not respect the sign of the Red
Cross, and thereby violated Article 9 of the Convention
of Geneva of July 6th, 1906. In particular, they
did not scruple to fire on German troops under the
cover of this sign, and also to attack hospitals in
which there were wounded, as well as members of
the Ambulance Corps, while they were occupied in
carrying out their duties (Appendices 3, 4, 12, 19,
23, 28, 29, 41, 49; C 9, 16-18, 32, 56, 66-70; D 9, 21,
25-29, 38, 47). Finally, it is proved beyond all doubt
that German wounded were robbed and killed by the
Belgian population, and indeed were subjected to
horrible mutilation, and that even women and young
girls took part in these shameful actions. In this
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
way the eyes of German wounded were torn out,
their ears, nose, fingers, and sexual organs were cut
off, or their body cut open (Appendices 54-66; C 73,
78; D 35, 37). In other cases German soldiers were
poisoned, hung on trees, deluged with burning liquid,
or burnt in other ways, so that they suffered a specially
painful death (Appendices 50, 55, 63; C 56,
59, 61, 67, 74-78). This bestial behaviour of the population
is not only in open contravention of the express
obligation for “respecting and taking care of”
the sick and wounded of the hostile army (Article
1, Section 1, of the Convention of Geneva), but also
of the first principles of the laws of war and humanity.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Under these circumstances, the Belgian civil population
who took part in the struggle could of course
make no claim to the treatment to which belligerents
have a right. On the contrary, it was absolutely
necessary, in the interests of the self-preservation of
the German Army, to have recourse to the sharpest
measures against these <em lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">francs-tireurs</em>. Individuals
who opposed the German troops by fighting had,
therefore, to be cut down; prisoners could not be
treated as prisoners of war according to the laws
of war, but according to the usage of war as murderers.
All the same, the forms of judicial procedure
were maintained so far as the necessities of
war did not stand in the way; the prisoners were,
so far as the circumstances permitted, not shot till
after a hearing in accordance with regulations, or
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
after sentence by a military court. (Appendices
48, D 19, 20, 37, 40, 41, 43, 44, 48.) Old men, women
and children were spared to the widest extent, even
when there were urgent grounds of suspicion (Appendices
49; C 5, 6, 25, 26, 28, 31, 35, 41, 47, 79);
indeed, the German soldiers often looked after such
persons so far as was in any way possible in the most
self-sacrificing manner by taking helpless people who
were in danger under their protection, sharing their
bread with them and taking charge of the weak and
sick, although their patience had been subjected
to an extraordinary difficult test by the treacherous
attacks (Appendices C 45, 47, 51-53, 55, 58,
80-86).</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>There can be no doubt that the Belgian Government
was essentially to blame for the illegal attitude
of their population towards the German Army.
For apart from the fact that a Government has,
under all circumstances, to bear the responsibility
for deeds of this kind which give a general expression
of the popular will, the serious charge must at
least be made against them that they did not stop
this guerilla war, although they could have done
so (Appendices 33, 51-53; D 42, 43, 48). It would
certainly have been easy for them to provide their
officials, such as the Burgomasters, the soldiers, members
of the “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Guarde Civique,</span>” with the necessary
instructions to check the violent excitement of the
people which had been artificially aroused. Full responsibility,
therefore, for the terrible blood-guiltiness
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>
which rests upon Belgian attach&eacute;s to the Belgian
Government.</p>

<p>The Belgian Government has made an attempt to
free itself from this responsibility by attributing the
blame for the events to the rage of destruction of
the German troops, who are said to have taken to
deeds of violence without any reason. They have
appointed a Commission for investigating the outrages
attributed to the German troops, and have
made the findings of this Commission the subject of
Diplomatic complaint. This attempt to pervert the
facts into their opposite has completely failed. The
German Army is accustomed to make war only
against hostile armies, and not against peaceful inhabitants.
The incontrovertible fact that from the
beginning a defensive struggle in the interests of
self-protection was forced upon the German troops
in Belgium by the population of the country cannot
be done away with by the inquiry of any commission.</p>

<p>The narratives of fugitives which have been put
together by the Belgian Commission, and which are
characterised as the result of careful and impartial
investigation, bear the stamp of untrustworthiness,
if not of malicious invention. In consequence of the
conditions of things, the Commission was not in a
position to test the reports which were conveyed to
it as to their correctness or to grasp the connection
of events. Their accusations against the German
Army are, therefore, nothing but low calumniations,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span>
which are simply deprived of all their weight by
the documentary evidence which is before us.</p>

<p>The struggle of the German troops with the Belgian
civil population at Aerschot did not, as is suggested
on the Belgian side, arise through the German
officers violating the honour of the Burgomaster’s
family, but because the population ventured
on a well-considered attack on the Commanding Officer,
and murdered him treacherously (Appendix A).
At Dinant it was not harmless, peaceful citizens who
fell as a sacrifice to the German arms, but murderers
who treacherously attacked German soldiers,
and thereby involved the troops in a struggle which
destroyed the city (Appendix C). In Louvain the
struggle of the civil population did not arise through
fleeing German troops being by mistake involved in
a hand-to-hand contest with their comrades who were
entering the town, but because the population, blinded
as they were and unable to understand what was
going on, thought they could destroy the returning
German troops without danger (Appendix D).
Moreover, in Louvain, as in other towns, the conflagration
was only started by the German troops
when bitter necessity required it. The plan of the
destruction of Louvain (Appendix D 50) shows
clearly how the troops confined themselves to destroying
only those parts of the city in which the
inhabitants opposed them in a treacherous and murderous
manner. It was indeed German troops who,
so far as was possible, tried to save the artistic treasures,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
not only of Louvain, but also of other towns.
On the German side, a Special Commission has shown
to what a high degree works of art in Belgium were
protected by the German troops.</p>

<p>The Imperial German Government believes that
by the publication of the material contained in this
work, they have shown that the action of the German
troops against the Belgian civil population was
provoked by the illegal guerilla war, and was required
by the necessity of war. For their part,
they expressly and solemnly protest against a population
which has, with the most despicable means,
waged a dishonourable war against the German soldiers,
and still more against the Government which,
in complete perversion of their duties, has given rein
to the senseless passions of the population, and even
now does not scruple to free itself from its own
heavy guilt by mendacious libels against the German
Army.</p>

MASSACRE OF BRITISH PRISONERS BY GERMAN SOLDIERS
AT HAISNES ON SEPTEMBER 25TH, 1915</h3>

<p>I, Captain J. E. A&mdash;&mdash;, 8th Batt. &mdash;&mdash; Highlanders,
make oath and say as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>(1) I command C Co. of the 8th Batt. &mdash;&mdash; Highlanders.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
My company took part in the attack on
September 25th, 1915. Between 5 and 6 p.m. on that
day we were attacked and compelled to retire from
an advanced position about Haisnes. We moved into
Pekin Trench, and later to Fosse Alley. The battalion
commenced to reorganise there.</p>

<p>(2) Just before 8 p.m. 2nd Lieut. G. T. G&mdash;&mdash;,
of my battalion, reported to me that Sergeant D.
M&mdash;&mdash;, who had been attached to my company for
the day, had just returned in an exhausted condition,
and that he reported that the Germans had
collected our wounded and prisoners and bombed
them.</p>

<p>Instructed Lieut. G&mdash;&mdash; to bring Sergeant M&mdash;&mdash;
to me at once. This was done. 2nd Lieut. G. T.
G&mdash;&mdash; has since died of wounds.</p>

<p>(3) Sergeant M&mdash;&mdash; reported to me that he and
a party of men had been collected in a traverse by
the Germans and bombed from both sides, that he
and a Highlander had jumped out of the traverse,
and that he had escaped into a shell hole, whilst the
Highlander had been shot.</p>

<p>The Sergeant, D. M&mdash;&mdash;, was very exhausted and
covered with mud and water up to the neck. He
was not in an excited condition.</p>

<p>He carried on with his duties reorganising the
company.</p>

<p>(4) The story as told to me by Sergeant M&mdash;&mdash;
at that time has been adhered to by him ever since
without any material alteration.

<span class="i8">Commissioner for Oaths.</span></p>

<p>I, No. 6546, Sergeant D. M&mdash;&mdash;, of D Co., 8th
---- Highlanders, make oath and say as follows:</p>

<p>(1) On September 25th, 1915, I was attached to
C Co., 8th &mdash;&mdash; Highanders. I took part in the
attack on Haisnes on that day.</p>

<p>About 5 p.m. the part of this company commanded
by Lieut. A&mdash;&mdash; with which I was in trenches just
west of Haisnes, and was going to retire.</p>

<p>Lieut. A&mdash;&mdash; ordered me to collect stragglers from
Pekin Trench.</p>

<p>(2) I went 400-500 yards along Pekin Trench and
found about twenty wounded men of various regiments,
all Scottish, whose names I did not know.</p>

<p>I left these men sitting down and went about 100
yards further on and found about twenty men of
the &mdash;&mdash; Highlanders, about ten of whom were
wounded.</p>

<p>(3) It was now 5.15 p.m., and I could see that
the Germans had cut me and all these men off from
our own troops. I took the men of the &mdash;&mdash; Highlanders
back to where the others were. I now had
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span>
about forty men with me. For the sake of the
wounded men we decided to surrender.</p>

<p>(4) We all took off our rifles and equipment and
put them on top of the parapet.</p>

<p>I stood on top of the parapet and held up my
hands.</p>

<p>A large party of Germans then advanced both in
the open and by the trenches towards us.</p>

<p>When they drew near I said, “We surrender.”
One German, speaking English, said, “All right.
Come along this way, every one.” We all followed
him up Pekin Trench towards the north, helping the
wounded along, and leaving our rifles and equipment
behind. It now began to pour in torrents of rain.</p>

<p>(5) The German who spoke English was dressed
in dark khaki and wearing a cape down to his thighs.
He had khaki trousers with a thin red stripe and
long black boots. He wore a helmet with a dark
khaki cover on it. He had no badges showing. His
cape blew open and I saw a figure 6 in red on his
shoulder and, I think but am not sure, a figure 2 in
part of it, making 26.</p>

<p>All these Germans were big men and were dressed
alike, quite clean and fresh as though they had only
just come into the trenches. I did not notice anyone
in command of them.</p>

<p>Their manner was not threatening.</p>

<p>(6) About thirty of these Germans led us into a
circular traverse in Pekin Trench, and the English-speaking
German said, “Pack in there and stay.”
All the Germans then went out of sight. The
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span>
wounded men sat on the fire-step and the unwounded
remained standing. It was now about 5.30 p.m.</p>

<p>(7) After we had been there about two minutes a
bomb was thrown into the traverse where we were,
one bomb from one side and one from the other.</p>

<p>I shouted to the men to clear out if possible. Only
one man and myself jumped over the parapet. I
seized an English rifle lying on the parapet and fired
down the trench. I then jumped into a shell hole
about 15 yards from the traverse. It was almost full
of water, in which I stood up to my neck. The other
man was shot.</p>

<p>I heard the Germans bombing this circular traverse
continuously for about fifteen minutes. At first the
men I left were crying out, but after about ten minutes
this ceased.</p>

<p>(8) I was over an hour in the shell hole, and left
it after dark.</p>

<p>2nd Lieut. G. T. G&mdash;&mdash;, of D Co., 8th &mdash;&mdash; Highlanders,
was the first person to whom I told my experiences.
This was at about 7.45 p.m.</p>

<p>(9) The second person to whom I told them was
Capt. J. E. A&mdash;&mdash;, also of the 8th &mdash;&mdash;, whom I saw
at about 8 p.m. the same evening.</p>

<h4><span class="smcap">Use of Incendiary Bullets by the Enemy</span></h4>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;I have the honour to report as follows:</p>

<p>During the action on 15th to 16th instant my platoon
occupied the right of the old German trench
running from &mdash;&mdash; to &mdash;&mdash; between 7.30 p.m. and
10.30 p.m., 15th instant. Seventy-five yards to my
front I saw six or seven men lying down in the grass.
One of them attracted my attention immediately as
he appeared to be smoking or to have lit a small
fire. I observed him carefully and saw that his
clothes were smouldering. Later on they were entirely
charred black: he did not move and was apparently
dead. The enemy were sniping at these
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
men, unquestionably using incendiary bullets, as I
saw three or four of these strike the ground and set
the grass around on fire. The flames could be seen
distinctly.</p>

<p>About 9 p.m. one of these bullets struck the bottom
of the parapet of the trench, and burned with
a brilliant white flare for about fifteen seconds, at
the same time giving off heavy phosphorus fumes and
burning the sand-bags which it had struck.</p>

<p>The following statements were made by N.C.O.’s
of the 2nd Batt. &mdash;&mdash; Regiment and 2nd Batt. &mdash;&mdash;
Regiment (7th Division), relative to the alleged use
by the enemy on June 15th, 1915, of incendiary
bullets:</p>

<p>C.S.M. G. M&mdash;&mdash;, C Co., 2nd Batt. &mdash;&mdash; Regiment,
states:</p>

<p>On the night of the 15th and 16th I saw German
rifle bullets cause a flash as they struck the ground.
The flash seemed to rise about 2 feet from the ground.
My attention was called to this by an Officer of the
3rd Co. (?) Grenadier Guards. The Guards were
on my left and I was near &mdash;&mdash;. It was some time
between 11 p.m. and 12 midnight.</p>

<p>Sergeant N&mdash;&mdash;, B Co., 2nd &mdash;&mdash; Regiment, states:</p>

<p>Just before dusk on the evening of the 15th I was
in the disused German trench &mdash;&mdash;, and saw a man
fall in front of the trench hit by a bullet. As he
lay on the ground he seemed to be on fire in the
right shoulder and breast, and was clawing the
ground in agony. (The grass, which was green, was
set on fire round him.) He was not more than 100
yards from me&mdash;hardly that. I could not do anything
for him as the Germans had been following me
and were almost on top of me, and I was nearly alone
at the time.</p>

<p>Very shortly afterwards I saw another man (a
Lance-Corpl. in the &mdash;&mdash; I think), run out apparently
to fetch in the first man. He slewed off, and
must have seen the Germans, who were then crawling
through the grass. He fell, seemingly hit in
the stomach, and whilst rolling about on his back, his
right knee and his puttees down to his boot caught
fire. I think he must have been hit in the knee. He
too seemed to be in agony, and the grass caught
fire round him also. I could not swear that his second
wound was not caused by a bomb, though I
did not see any bomb burst there.</p>

<p>Corporal D&mdash;&mdash;, B Co., 2nd Batt. &mdash;&mdash; Regiment,
states:</p>

<p>Shortly after the bombardment on the evening of
the 15th instant, I was just on the left of the crater
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
(near &mdash;&mdash;)&mdash;about 30 yards from the crater&mdash;and
saw a man on fire in the grass in front of and below
me. Another man ran out of a disused trench
towards the first man, when he appeared to be hit
in the chest. He fell forward on his chest, and
as he did so flames spurted out of his chest. As he
lay on the ground he was burning all over, and the
cartridges in his bandolier went off. He burned
for about an hour and the grass was set on fire.
Both men were rather less than 100 yards from me.
I called the attention of my Officer Mr. L. J&mdash;&mdash;
(subsequently wounded) to the second man. I am
quite sure the second man was hit by a bullet, not
a bomb.</p>

<h3>A FRESH EXAMINATION OF GERMAN WAR
METHODS<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a></h3>

<p>Professor Morgan, whose bright little book, called
“Sketches From the Front,” has given to us some
of the most fresh and vivid pictures of the actualities
of warfare in France, presents in the present volume
the evidence he has been busy in collecting regarding
the behaviour of the German troops in the
western theatre of war. Some of this has already been
made known to the public by what he published in the
<cite>Nineteenth Century and After</cite> in June, 1915, and also
by the depositions which he obtained under the instructions
of the Home Office and submitted to the
British Committee on Alleged German Outrages.
(Many of these were published in the Appendix to
their Report last May.) Since that time he has spent
four or five months in collecting further important
data and still more months in collating the results of
the facts he has collected, having been granted by the
British Headquarters Staff in France those facilities
for moving to and fro along the front and getting
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
into touch with eye-witnesses which were essential for
arriving directly at the facts. The evidence thus obtained
is supplemented by several diaries of German
soldiers never before published in England, and by
some extracts from documents issued by the Russian
Government describing cruelties committed by the
Germans in the fighting on the Eastern front. As
respects the data he has himself collected, Professor
Morgan explains, in his introduction, the methods he
has followed in taking evidence and testing its value,
showing himself sensible, as a lawyer ought to be, of
the need for care and caution in such a matter. The
large experience which his months of work at the front
have given him adds weight to his assurance that
what he submits is worthy of all credence as well as
to the conclusions at which he has arrived. But before
adverting to these conclusions a preliminary question
deserves to be considered.</p>

<p>It has been asked&mdash;and it is natural that it should
he asked&mdash;“What is the use of multiplying tales of
horror?” “Why do anything that can aggravate the
bitterness of feeling, already lamentably acute, between
the belligerent nations? All war is horrible;
why add fresh items to the list of offences which are
making us think worse of human nature than we
supposed two years ago we ever could think?”</p>

<p>These questions need an answer. Such a painful
record as the present book contains, such a record as
can be found in the reports already officially published
by the Belgian, French, and British Governments,
might, perhaps, have been better left unpublished
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
if it did not serve some definite tangible aim,
looking to some permanent good for mankind.</p>

<p>Now such a definite, tangible, practical aim does
exist, and seems to justify, and, indeed, to require, the
publication of the facts contained in this book and
also in the reports which have been published by the
Belgian, French, and British Governments. It is an
aim which can be stated quite shortly; and the need
for pursuing it is shown by what has happened during
the last twenty months.</p>

<p>In most parts of the ancient world, and among the
semi-civilised peoples of Asia till very recent times,
wars were waged against combatants and non-combatants
alike. Even in the European Middle Ages
indiscriminate slaughter of combatants and non-combatants
alike sometimes occurred, especially where, as
in the case of the Albigenses, religious passion intensified
hatred. As late as the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries there were campaigns in which frightful
license was allowed to soldiery, private property was
pillaged or ruthlessly destroyed, and women were
habitually outraged.</p>

<p>A reaction of sentiment caused by the horror of the
Thirty Years’ War, coupled with a general softening
of manners, brought about a change. During the last
two centuries, though every war was marked by shocking
incidents, there was a growing feeling that non-combatants
should be protected, and a serious purpose
to restrain the excesses of troops invading a hostile
country. The wars of the eighteenth century were
less cruel and destructive than those of the seventeenth,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
and the wars of the nineteenth showed some
improvement on those of the eighteenth. The war of
1870-71, if those of us in Britain who remember it
can trust our recollection, seemed better in both the
above-named respects than had been the Revolutionary
and Napoleonic wars between 1793 and 1814.
Till the outbreak of the present conflict men who
sought for signs of the progress of mankind were
cheered by the hope that war would hereafter be
waged only between regular disciplined forces on
each side; that these forces would abstain from needless
cruelty, that women would be protected from
lust, and that the lives of non-combatants would not
be endangered. There was even a prospect that private
property would not be destroyed except in so far
as a definite military aim made its destruction unavoidable,
as when a hostile force had to be shelled
out of its shelter in a village. The Hague Convention
had passed rules which ameliorated the practices
of war as regards the combatant forces and had
solemnly proclaimed the duty of respecting the lives
and property of non-combatant civilians.</p>

<p>The present war has, however, brought a rude awakening.
The proofs are now overwhelming that in Belgium
and Northern France&mdash;as to other regions the
evidence is not fully before us&mdash;non-combatants have
been slaughtered without mercy by the orders of the
German military authorities, while the mitigations of
war usages as regards combatants have been openly
and constantly disregarded. Private property has
been constantly destroyed where no specific military
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
reason existed, but only for the sake of terrorising the
civil population, or perhaps out of sheer malice. A
license has been practised by, and in many cases obviously
permitted to, the soldiers which has led to acts
of wanton cruelty. Outrages upon women have been
far more numerous than in any war between civilised
nations during the last hundred years. One crime
deserves special condemnation, because it is done deliberately
and is justified by its perpetrators. This
is the practice of seizing innocent non-combatants,
usually the leading inhabitants of a town or village,
calling them hostages and executing them in cold
blood if the population of the town or village whom
“the hostages” cannot control, fail to obey the commands
of the invaders. Civilians who fire upon invading
troops without observing the requirements
which the Hague Convention prescribes may, no doubt,
be shot according to the customs of war; but there
must be some proof that these particular civilians
have done so. To put to death a quarter or more of
the adult male inhabitants of a village because some
shots have been fired, or are supposed by an excited
soldiery to have been fired, out of its houses, is mere
murder. All the paragraphs in the Manual of War
issued by the German Staff cannot make it anything
else.</p>

<p>Though we may hope, and indeed must hope, that
the horror caused by this war may lead to measures
which will diminish the risks of war in the future,
he must be indeed a sanguine man who can think
that war, the oldest of the curses that have afflicted
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span>
mankind, is likely to be eradicated within this century.
It is therefore an urgent duty to do all that
can be done for a regulation of the methods of war
and a mitigation of the sufferings that it causes.</p>

<p>Now the cruelties that have been perpetrated on
land, no less than the ruthless murder of innocent
passengers on unarmed vessels at sea, are an aggravation
of those sufferings. They are a reversion to the
ancient methods of savagery, a challenge to civilised
mankind, to neutral nations as well as to the now
belligerent States. Neutral nations ought to be fully
informed of the facts of these methods, for they are
themselves concerned. The same methods may be
used against them if they are attacked by Germany
or by some other nation which sees that Germany
has used them with impunity. If the public opinion
of the world does not condemn these methods, war will
become an even greater curse than it has been heretofore.
Unless an effort is made as soon as ever the
present conflict ends to regulate the conduct of hostilities
between combatant forces, and, which is of
even greater importance, to provide more effective
safeguards for non-combatants, there may be a terrible
relapse towards barbarism everywhere.</p>

<p>The Allied belligerent nations who are now fighting
in the cause of humanity are called upon to take
up this matter and deal with it effectively. So are
neutral nations. It is a pity that they did not protest
long ago. But a word may be said regarding the German
people also. Professor Morgan thinks that they
share in all the guilt of their Government, but the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
reasons he gives for this belief do not warrant so
melancholy a conclusion. The behaviour of the mobs
that were wont to insult and ill-treat the prisoners of
war led through the streets of German towns, and
the ferocious language of creatures like Von Reventlow
and some other writers in the German Press,
shocking as they are, cannot be taken as evidence of
the sentiments of a whole people. Neither can we
suppose that the declarations of professors, victims
of a doctrine and a practice which compels them to
approve every act of the State are more to be accepted
as expressing what may be felt by the less vocal Germans.
We must remember how severe is the German
censorship, how accustomed the Germans are to
believe what their Government tells them, how habitually
mendacious the military authorities have been in
the accounts they supply of the conduct of the Allied
Powers and their troops. The German mind has had
little but falsehood to feed upon ever since the outbreak
of the war, and it now believes, absurd as the
belief is, that it is the innocent victim of an unprovoked
aggression. When any voice is raised in Germany
to proclaim even a part of the truth and to
plead for humanity and good feeling, that voice is
instantly silenced. Silence will doubtless be enforced
as long as the war lasts. But we may well venture
to hope that when, after the war, the facts hitherto
concealed from the people have become known and
can be reflected on with calmness, there will be a
condemnation of the practices I have described, and
that in Germany and Austria, as well as in all neutral
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
countries, there will be a wish to join in the efforts
which both the Allies and the leading neutral Powers
are sure to make to regulate and mitigate the conduct
of war. In order to call forth these efforts by
showing how great is the need for strengthening the
existing rules of war, and providing more effective
means of securing their observance, it is essential that
the facts should be made known and studied, and
that the world should see how the present rules, imperfect
as they are, have been trampled under foot
by the German authorities. This is what makes it
right and necessary to publish the data contained in
the Reports already referred to, and those data also
which have been gathered by Professor Morgan with
such earnest labour.</p>

<p>So much for the justification&mdash;an ample justification&mdash;which
exists for publishing the horrible record
which this book contains. I need not here analyse
it or quote from it or comment upon it. The facts
speak for themselves. Professor Morgan’s general
conclusions as to the behaviour of the German troops
in France seem to be borne out by the facts which he
adduces. They are further supported by the facts
set forth in the Belgian, French, and British Reports.
This accumulation of testimony is convincing, and it
becomes even abundantly more convincing when one
remembers that the German Government has scarcely
attempted to deny the contents of those reports. To
the French report, strengthened as it is by numerous
extracts from the diaries of German soldiers (translated
by M. Joseph B&eacute;dier), in which they describe,
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
sometimes with shame, sometimes with satisfaction,
the conduct of their comrades, no answer seems to
have been made, although a few trivial objections were
raised to the translations. Neither has the German
Government ventured to meet the British report, except
by a vaguely worded general contradiction in a
semi-official newspaper. As regards the Belgian reports,
no more to them than to the others has any
examination and specific contradiction been vouchsafed.
But a White Book has been published which
tries to turn the tables by accusing Belgian civilians
generally of firing on German troops and committing
outrages upon them. Professor Morgan, in one of
the most illuminative parts of his book, subjects
this White Book to a critical analysis, exposes its
hollowness, and shows conclusively that while it does
not prove the German case against the civilian population
and the Government of Belgium, it virtually
admits, in its attempts to justify, the shocking cruelties
perpetrated by the German Army upon that population.
As the lawyers say, <em lang="la" xml:lang="la">habemus confitentem
reum</em>.</p>

<p>Let me add that he who wishes to understand German
military ideas and military methods, ought to
read along with this book (and the reports already
referred to) another book, the German “Manual of
the Usages of War on Land,” of which Professor
Morgan has published a translation, under the title of
“The German War Book.” Each of these is a complement
to the other. The “War Book” sets forth
the principles: this book and the Reports display the
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
practices. The practice shocks us more, because concrete
cases of cruelty rouse a livelier indignation; but
the principles are a more melancholy proof of the extent
to which minds of able men may be so perverted
by false ideals and national vanity as to lose the common
human sense of right and wrong.</p>

I know, no one in this country has noticed that the absolute
inviolability of Belgium, under all circumstances and without

<em>See</em> the Appendix to the Bryce Report, pages 25-29. Any
one who reads the depositions of the Belgian witnesses there set
out, and compares them with the depositions of the German
soldiers in the White Book cannot fail to be struck by certain
notable differences in quality. The Belgian witnesses never
generalise, they betray no malice, and they mention instances of
German forbearance. The exact converse is true of the German
evidence. Lord Bryce’s Committee came to the conclusion that
they “have no reason to believe that the civilian population of
Dinant gave any provocation.” (Report, page 20.) <em>See also</em>
the Eleventh Belgian Report (<cite lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Rapports officiels</cite>, page 137).</p></div>

The story of Aerschot is peculiarly horrible. It was here
that the priest was placed against the wall with his arms
raised above his head; when he let them fall through weariness,
the German soldiers brought the butt-ends of their rifles
down upon his feet. He was kept there for hours, and as
German soldiers passed they used him as a lavatory and a
latrine until he was covered with filth. Eventually they shot
him. This is but one of many such horrors (<em>see</em> the Bryce
Report, Appendix, pages 29, 46. <em>See also</em> the fourth and fifth
Belgian Reports). The German White Book admits (Appendix
A 2) that “every third man was shot.”</p></div>

Long ago&mdash;in 1870&mdash;Fustel de Coulanges pointed out that
the crime which, to use the words of our law, “is not to be

nowhere else, and the immorality of latter-day Germany was the
subject of a mournful lamentation by Treitschke in his old age.

It is a curious fact, attested by the evidence of a large
number of British and French soldiers who have been in action,
that the German soldier often exhibits the most abject fear
when confronted individually with the bayonet, going down on

One might go further and say that the Geneva Convention,
which has hitherto been universally regarded as a law of perfect
obligation and which even the German Staff in the German
War Book affects to treat as sacred, is perverted to an
instrument of treachery. The emblem of the Red Cross was
used to protect waggons in which machine-guns were concealed.
And since this article was written a German hospital ship, the
<em>Ophelia</em>, has been condemned, on irrefutable evidence, by our
Prize Court as having been used for belligerent purposes. Such
things throw a very lurid light on the German conception of
honour.</p></div>

The German officers spoke Hindustani. Doubtless they knew,
as I have found they often know, the identity of the British
regiments opposite their positions and were attached there for
the express purpose of dealing with Indians. But in no case,
so far as I know, were their attempts to seduce our Indian
troops successful.</p></div>

The passage suggests that our wounded were killed, but it

to escape with the others. The fact of some prisoners being

<span class="smcap">Note.</span>&mdash;This diary is a laconic example of a hundred such
village tragedies. According to the Eleventh Belgian Report
(page 133), twenty-six priests and monks were shot in Namur
alone. And see the pastoral letter of Cardinal Mercier (<em>ibid.</em>,
page 165) on what he calls “this sinister necrology.” In his
own diocese alone (that of Malines) he records thirteen priests
as having been killed. According to a German soldier the guilt
of priests was established by the fact that church-bells often
rang!&mdash;(Bryce Appendix, page 163).</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_95" href="#FNanchor_95" class="label">95</a>
This savage credulity found its sequel in the murder of

These documents have been placed in my hands by the

<div class="footnote">

<p><a id="Footnote_97" href="#FNanchor_97" class="label">97</a>
This and the two following depositions are selected from a
number of statements, mostly by Russian prisoners in German
hands, who succeeded in escaping to the British lines. The
statements (<em>b</em>) and (<em>c</em>) by these Russian soldiers are confirmed
by the statement (<em>a</em>) which was volunteered by a German soldier,
Stephan Grzegoroski, taken prisoner by the British troops.
It is hardly necessary to point out that the employment of
prisoners of war upon military works and their exposure to
fire constitute a flagrant breach, not only of the Hague Regulations,
but of the unwritten laws and usages of war.&mdash;J. H. M.</p></div>

Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
